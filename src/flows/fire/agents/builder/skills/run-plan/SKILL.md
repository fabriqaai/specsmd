<objective>
Plan the scope of a run by discovering available work items and suggesting groupings.
</objective>

<triggers>
  - After work-item decomposition completes
  - User wants to start execution
  - Pending work items exist
</triggers>

<degrees_of_freedom>
  **MEDIUM** — Present smart grouping suggestions but let user choose scope.
</degrees_of_freedom>

<llm critical="true">
  <mandate>DISCOVER all available work — both in state.yaml AND file system</mandate>
  <mandate>FILE SYSTEM IS SOURCE OF TRUTH — state.yaml may be incomplete</mandate>
  <mandate>ALWAYS SCAN FILE SYSTEM — even if state.yaml shows all completed</mandate>
  <mandate>SUGGEST smart groupings based on mode, dependencies, and user history</mandate>
  <mandate>LEARN from user choices to improve future recommendations</mandate>
  <mandate>NEVER force a scope — always let user choose</mandate>
  <mandate>DEPENDENCIES = SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION, NOT SEPARATE RUNS</mandate>
</llm>

<critical_clarifications>
  <clarification title="Dependencies Mean Sequential Execution, NOT Separate Runs">
    When work items have dependencies:
    - They execute **sequentially within the SAME run**
    - They do **NOT** require separate runs
    - The dependent item waits for its dependency to complete before starting

    **Example**: If item 05 depends on item 04:
    - **CORRECT**: ONE run with both items, 04 executes first, then 05
    - **WRONG**: TWO separate runs
  </clarification>

  <clarification title="All Options Can Include Multiple Items Per Run">
    | Option | Items Per Run | Execution |
    |--------|---------------|-----------|
    | Single | 1 item | One at a time, separate runs |
    | Batch | Multiple items (same mode) | Sequential within run |
    | Wide | All compatible items | Sequential within run |

  **Frontmatter parsing**:

- Extract `id`, `title`, `status` from YAML frontmatter
- If status missing, default to `pending`
- If in file but not state.yaml, add to state
</file_discovery_logic>

<grouping_algorithm>

  ```
  1. Collect all pending items with their modes
  2. Build dependency graph
  3. Sort items in dependency order (dependencies first)
  4. For "single" option:
     - Each item is its own run
  5. For "batch" or "wide" option:
     - ALL items in ONE run
     - Execution order follows dependency graph
     - Checkpoints pause at confirm/validate items
  ```

  ```
  IF run_scope_history has 3+ same choices:
