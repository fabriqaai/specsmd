<objective>
Generate implementation walkthrough for human review after run completion.
</objective>

<triggers>
  - Run completed successfully
  - Invoked by run-execute skill
</triggers>

<degrees_of_freedom>
  **LOW** — Follow walkthrough structure precisely. Be thorough but concise.

<llm critical="true">
  <mandate>ALWAYS generate walkthrough after run completion</mandate>
  <mandate>Document DECISIONS, not just changes</mandate>
  <mandate>Include verification steps — how to test this works</mandate>
