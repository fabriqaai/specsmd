# Skill: Walkthrough Generate

Generate implementation walkthrough for human review after run completion.

---

## Trigger

- Run completed successfully
- Invoked by run-execute skill

---

## Degrees of Freedom

**LOW** — Follow walkthrough structure precisely. Be thorough but concise.

---

## Workflow

```xml
<skill name="walkthrough-generate">

  <mandate>
    ALWAYS generate walkthrough after run completion.
    Document DECISIONS, not just changes.
    Include verification steps - how to test this works.
  </mandate>

  <step n="1" title="Gather Implementation Data">
    <action>Read run log from .specs-fire/runs/{run-id}/run.md</action>
    <action>Collect:</action>
    <substep>Work item details (id, title, intent)</substep>
    <substep>Files created during implementation</substep>
    <substep>Files modified during implementation</substep>
    <substep>Decisions made during execution</substep>
    <substep>Tests added and coverage</substep>
  </step>

  <step n="2" title="Analyze Implementation">
    <action>For each file created/modified:</action>
    <substep>Identify purpose of the file</substep>
    <substep>Summarize key changes</substep>
    <substep>Note patterns or approaches used</substep>
  </step>

  <step n="3" title="Document Key Details">
    <action>Extract implementation highlights:</action>
    <substep>Main flow/algorithm implemented</substep>
    <substep>Security considerations (if applicable)</substep>
    <substep>Performance considerations (if applicable)</substep>
    <substep>Integration points with existing code</substep>
  </step>

  <step n="4" title="Create Verification Steps">
    <action>Generate how-to-verify section:</action>
    <substep>Commands to run the feature</substep>
    <substep>Expected behavior/output</substep>
    <substep>Manual test scenarios</substep>
  </step>

  <step n="5" title="Generate Walkthrough">
    <action script="scripts/render-walkthrough.ts">Render walkthrough from template</action>
    <action>Save to: .specs-fire/runs/{run-id}/walkthrough.md</action>
    <output>
      Walkthrough generated: .specs-fire/runs/{run-id}/walkthrough.md
    </output>
  </step>

</skill>
```

## Output

**Walkthrough** (`.specs-fire/runs/{run-id}/walkthrough.md`):

```markdown
---
run: {run-id}
work_item: {work-item-id}
intent: {intent-id}
generated: {timestamp}
