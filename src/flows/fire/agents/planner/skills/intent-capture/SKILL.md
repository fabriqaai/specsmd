# Skill: Intent Capture

Capture user intent through guided conversation.

---

## Trigger

- No active intent exists
- User wants to start something new

---

## Degrees of Freedom

**HIGH** — This is a creative, exploratory phase. Ask open-ended questions. Don't constrain prematurely.

---

## Workflow

```xml
<skill name="intent-capture">

  <mandate>
    NEVER assume requirements. ALWAYS ask clarifying questions.
    Capture the "what" and "why" - leave the "how" for decomposition.
  </mandate>

  <step n="1" title="Initial Question">
    <ask>What do you want to build?</ask>
    <listen>Let user describe freely. Don't interrupt.</listen>
  </step>

  <step n="2" title="Elicit Context">
    <action>Based on response, ask follow-up questions:</action>

    <question if="unclear who benefits">
      Who is this for? Who will use this feature?
    </question>

    <question if="unclear problem">
      What problem does this solve? What's painful today?
    </question>

    <question if="unclear scope">
      What's the minimum that would be valuable? What can wait?
    </question>

    <question if="unclear constraints">
      Any technical constraints? Existing systems to integrate with?
    </question>

    <question if="unclear success">
      How will you know this is working? What does success look like?
    </question>
  </step>

  <step n="3" title="Summarize Understanding">
    <output>
      Let me make sure I understand:

      **Goal**: {summarized goal}
      **Users**: {who benefits}
      **Problem**: {what pain this solves}
      **Success**: {how to measure}

      Is this accurate? [Y/n/clarify]
    </output>
    <check if="response == clarify">
      <action>Ask specific clarifying questions</action>
      <goto step="3"/>
    </check>
  </step>

  <step n="4" title="Generate Intent Brief">
    <action>Create intent ID from title (kebab-case)</action>
    <action>Generate intent brief using template</action>
    <action>Create directory: .specs-fire/intents/{intent-id}/</action>
    <action>Save: .specs-fire/intents/{intent-id}/brief.md</action>
  </step>

  <step n="5" title="Update State">
    <action>Add intent to state.yaml</action>
    <action>Set intent status to "in_progress"</action>
  </step>

  <step n="6" title="Transition">
    <output>
      Intent captured: "{intent-title}"
      Saved to: .specs-fire/intents/{intent-id}/brief.md

      Ready to break this into work items? [Y/n]
