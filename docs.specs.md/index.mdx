## What is specs.md?

**specs.md** is a framework for spec-driven AI development that uses markdown-based agents to orchestrate your software development workflow. It supports pluggable development flows, with **AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Lifecycle)** as the first implemented flow.

## Framework Architecture

specs.md is built as a **pluggable framework** where development methodologies are implemented as **flows**:

```
specs.md (Framework)
├── Core (Memory Bank, Standards, Agents)
└── Flows/
    └── aidlc/          ← AI-DLC (first flow)
    └── (future flows...)
```

<Info>
  **AI-DLC** is the first implemented flow, based on the [AWS AI-Driven Development Lifecycle](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/ai-driven-development-life-cycle/) methodology. More flows can be added to support different development approaches.

## Key Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pluggable Flows">
    Development methodologies are implemented as flows. AI-DLC is the first flow, but the framework supports multiple approaches.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI-Native Design">
    Built from the ground up for AI-driven development. AI proposes plans, humans validate, AI executes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Human Oversight as Loss Function">
    Validation at each stage catches errors early before they cascade downstream. Each validation transforms artifacts into rich context for subsequent stages.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Design Techniques Built-In">
    Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is integral to the Construction phase, addressing the "whitespace" in Agile that has led to quality issues.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tool Agnostic">
    Works with Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and other AI coding assistants. Markdown-based agents work anywhere.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## AI-DLC Flow Overview

The AI-DLC flow implements three sequential phases:

| Phase | Purpose | Key Activities |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Inception** | What & Why | Requirements, Stories, Unit Decomposition, Bolt Planning |
| **Construction** | How to Build | Domain Design, Logical Design, Code, Tests |
| **Operations** | Deploy & Monitor | Build Artifacts, Deploy, Verify, Monitor |

## Supported Tools

specs.md is **IDE and AI-agnostic**—you choose your tools, no vendor lock-in.

<Info>
Unlike tools that lock you into a specific paid IDE, specs.md works with **any AI coding tool**. Your specs and agents are portable markdown files that work everywhere.

## Get Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install specs.md">
    ```bash
    npx specsmd@latest install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize your project">
    Run the Master Agent and type `project-init`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your first Intent">
    Use the Inception Agent to capture what you want to build
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why specs.md?

Traditional development methods were built for human-driven, long-running processes. **specs.md reimagines the development lifecycle** with AI as a central collaborator, enabling:

- **Rapid cycles** measured in hours or days rather than weeks
- **Complete planning upfront** through Mob Elaboration (weeks of work in hours)
- **Persistent context** that AI can reference across sessions
- **Structured artifacts** that build on each other progressively
