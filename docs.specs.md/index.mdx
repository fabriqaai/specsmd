## What is specs.md?

**specs.md** is an AI-native development framework with pluggable flows for every use case. Choose the flow that matches your project needs:

  >
    **Spec generation only**. Quick requirements, design, and task documents.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="FIRE Flow"
    icon="bolt"
    href="/fire-flow/overview"
  >
    **AI-DLC simplified**. Same philosophy, 0-2 adaptive checkpoints.
  </Card>
  <Card

    href="/core-concepts/intents"
  >
    **Full methodology**. Complete lifecycle with DDD and 4 agents.

## Framework Architecture

specs.md is built as a **pluggable framework** where development methodologies are implemented as **flows**:

```
specs.md (Framework)
├── Core (Standards, Agents, State)
└── Flows/
    ├── simple/     ← Spec generation only
    ├── fire/       ← Rapid execution (0-2 checkpoints)
    └── aidlc/      ← Full methodology with DDD
```

## Key Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Three Flows for Every Use Case">
    **Simple** for quick specs, **FIRE** for rapid execution, **AI-DLC** for full methodology. Choose based on your project needs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Adaptive Checkpoints (FIRE)">
    FIRE flow adapts oversight to complexity: 0 checkpoints for simple tasks, 1 for standard features, 2 for critical changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="First-Class Brownfield Support (FIRE)">
    Auto-detects existing patterns, respects conventions, and extends rather than rewrites your codebase.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monorepo Support (FIRE)">
    Hierarchical standards with module-specific overrides. One project, multiple tech stacks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Full DDD Methodology (AI-DLC)">
    Domain-Driven Design is integral to AI-DLC Construction phase for complex domains.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tool Agnostic">
    Works with Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and other AI coding assistants. Markdown-based agents work anywhere.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="VS Code Extension">
    Track your progress with our [sidebar extension](/getting-started/ide-extension) for VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf. Monitor progress, browse specs, and view project metrics visually.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Flow Comparison

| Aspect | Simple | FIRE | AI-DLC |
|--------|--------|------|--------|
| **Best For** | Spec generation | Solo/small teams | Teams, complex domains |
| **Checkpoints** | 3 (phase gates) | 0-2 (adaptive) | 10-26 per feature |
| **Agents** | 1 | 3 | 4 |
| **Execution Tracking** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **DDD** | No | No | Yes |
| **Monorepo** | No | First-class | Limited |

## Supported Tools

specs.md is **IDE and AI-agnostic**—you choose your tools, no vendor lock-in.

<Info>
Unlike tools that lock you into a specific paid IDE, specs.md works with **any AI coding tool**. Your specs and agents are portable markdown files that work everywhere.

## Get Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install specs.md">
    ```bash
    npx specsmd@latest install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your flow">
    Choose **Simple**, **FIRE**, or **AI-DLC** based on your project needs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start building">
    Invoke your flow's agent and describe what you want to build
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why specs.md?

Traditional development methods were built for human-driven, long-running processes. **specs.md reimagines the development lifecycle** with AI as a central collaborator:

- **Choose your overhead**: From no execution tracking (Simple) to full methodology (AI-DLC)
- **Adaptive checkpoints**: FIRE adapts oversight to complexity—skip ceremony for simple tasks
- **Brownfield-first**: FIRE auto-detects existing patterns and conventions
- **Persistent context**: AI can reference across sessions with structured artifacts
- **Rapid cycles**: Ship features in hours, not weeks
