description: Ship your first feature in under an hour with FIRE flow
---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- An AI coding tool (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- A project to work on (greenfield or brownfield)

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install specs.md">
    ```bash
    npx specsmd@latest install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select FIRE flow">
    When prompted, select **FIRE** as your development flow:
    ```
    ? Select a development flow:
      AI-DLC - Full methodology with DDD
    ❯ FIRE - Adaptive execution, brownfield & monorepo ready
      Simple - Spec generation only
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your AI tool">
    Select your preferred AI coding tool for agent configuration
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Your First Intent

### 1. Start the Planner Agent

In your AI coding tool, invoke the FIRE Planner:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Claude Code">
    ```
    /fire-planner
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cursor">
    ```
    /fire-planner
    ```
    Or use the `@` prefix:
    ```
    @fire-planner
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GitHub Copilot">
    ```
    @fire-planner
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Describe Your Intent

Tell the Planner what you want to build:

```
I want to add user authentication with email/password login,
password reset, and session management.
```

The Planner will:
1. Ask clarifying questions if needed
2. Create an intent document
3. Decompose it into work items

### 3. Review Work Items

The Planner generates work items with recommended execution modes:

```yaml
work_items:
  - id: user-schema
    title: Create user database schema
    complexity: low
    mode: autopilot      # AI executes directly

  - id: login-endpoint
    title: Implement login API endpoint
    complexity: medium
    mode: confirm        # Human confirms plan first

  - id: session-management
    title: Add session management
    complexity: high
    mode: validate       # Full review before execution
```

## Execute Work Items

### 1. Start the Builder Agent

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Claude Code">
    ```
    /fire-builder
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cursor">
    ```
    /fire-builder
    ```
    Or use the `@` prefix:
    ```
    @fire-builder
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GitHub Copilot">
    ```
    @fire-builder
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Builder Picks Next Work Item

The Builder automatically selects the next work item based on dependencies:

```
Starting work item: user-schema
Mode: Autopilot (0 checkpoints)

Executing...
```

### 3. Execution by Mode

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Autopilot Mode (0 checkpoints)">
    AI executes directly and generates a walkthrough:
    ```
    ✓ Created migration file: 20240115_create_users.sql
    ✓ Added User model: src/models/user.ts
    ✓ Updated schema exports

    Walkthrough generated: walkthroughs/run-001-user-schema.md
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Confirm Mode (1 checkpoint)">
    AI presents plan, waits for confirmation:
    ```
    Plan for: login-endpoint

    1. Create POST /auth/login endpoint
    2. Add password hashing with bcrypt
    3. Generate JWT tokens
    4. Add rate limiting

    [Confirm to proceed? y/n]
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Validate Mode (2 checkpoints)">
    AI generates design doc, waits for review, then confirmation:
    ```
    Design document generated: intents/auth/work-items/session-management.md

    Please review the design before proceeding.
    [Review complete? y/n]

    ---

    Implementation plan:
    1. Add Redis session store
    2. Implement session middleware
    3. Add logout endpoint

    [Approve implementation? y/n]
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 4. Review Walkthroughs

After each run, review the generated walkthrough:

```markdown
# Run 001: user-schema

## Summary
Created user database schema with email/password authentication fields.

## Files Changed
- `migrations/20240115_create_users.sql` (created)
- `src/models/user.ts` (created)
- `src/models/index.ts` (modified)

## Key Decisions
- Used UUID for user IDs (portable across databases)
- Added soft delete with deleted_at column
- Indexed email for fast lookups

## Verification Steps
1. Run `npm run migrate` to apply schema
2. Verify table created: `SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 1`

## Test Coverage
- Unit test added: `tests/models/user.test.ts`
```

## State Tracking

FIRE maintains state in `.specs-fire/state.yaml`:

```yaml
project:
  name: my-project
  framework: fire-v1

workspace:
  type: brownfield
  structure: monolith
  default_mode: confirm

intents:
  - id: auth-system
    title: User Authentication
    status: in_progress
    work_items:
      - id: user-schema
        status: done
        completed_in_run: 1
      - id: login-endpoint
        status: in_progress
        started_in_run: 2
      - id: session-management
        status: pending

runs:
  last_completed: 1
  active: 2
```

## Brownfield Projects

For existing codebases, FIRE auto-detects:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Quick Scan (2-5 min)">
    Pattern-based detection of language, framework, and structure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Standards Generation">
    AI generates standards matching your existing patterns:
    - Tech stack (detected frameworks, libraries)
    - Coding standards (existing conventions)
    - Folder structure (current layout)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Confirm">
    Review generated standards and adjust if needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  FIRE follows **brownfield rules**: search before create, respect patterns, minimal changes.
</Info>

## Monorepo Projects

For monorepos, FIRE supports hierarchical standards:

```
project/
├── .specs-fire/
│   └── standards/
│       ├── constitution.md      # Universal (always inherited)
│       └── tech-stack.md        # Default stack
│
├── packages/api/
│   └── .specs-fire/
│       └── standards/
│           └── tech-stack.md    # Override: Go, Echo
│
└── packages/web/
    └── .specs-fire/
        └── standards/
            └── tech-stack.md    # Override: React, TypeScript
```

## Command Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/fire-orchestrator` | Entry point, routes to appropriate agent |
| `/fire-planner` | Capture intents, decompose work items |
| `/fire-builder` | Execute work items, generate walkthroughs |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent doesn't remember context">
    Agents are stateless—they read `state.yaml` and artifacts at startup. Ensure files are saved after each step.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Work item stuck">
    Check `.specs-fire/state.yaml` to see work item status. If blocked, the Builder will explain what's needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Want to change execution mode">
    You can override the suggested mode during execution. Say "Override to Confirm" or "Override to Validate".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Brownfield detection wrong">
    Review generated standards in `.specs-fire/standards/` and edit as needed. The Planner respects your overrides.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multiple intents exist">
    Run `/fire-orchestrator` to see all intents and their status, then specify which to work on.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
