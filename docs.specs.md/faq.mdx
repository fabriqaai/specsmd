## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is specs.md?">
    specs.md is an implementation of the AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) methodology. It provides markdown-based agents that work with your favorite AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot) to guide software development from requirements through deployment.

    We offer two modes:
    - **specs.md (AI-DLC)** - Full methodology for complex systems
    - **specs.md (Simple Flow)** - Lightweight mode for simpler projects

    Both are available now.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is AI-DLC?">
    AI-DLC is a software development methodology developed by AWS where AI drives the conversation and humans validate. Unlike traditional Agile with week-long sprints, AI-DLC operates in "Bolts" - rapid iterations measured in hours or days.

    Key principles:
    - **Reimagine, don't retrofit** - AI-DLC is built from first principles, not AI bolted onto Agile
    - **Reversed conversation** - AI proposes, humans validate (not vice versa)
    - **DDD as core** - Domain-Driven Design is integral, not optional

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What AI coding tools are supported?">
    specs.md supports:
    - **Claude Code** - Full support with slash commands
    - **Cursor** - Full support with rules
    - **GitHub Copilot** - Full support with agents
    - **Google Antigravity** - Full support with agents
    - **Any AI assistant** - Works with any tool that can read markdown prompts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is specs.md free?">
    Yes, specs.md is open source under the MIT license. You can use it freely in personal and commercial projects. You only pay for your AI API tokens.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who is specs.md for?">
    AI-DLC is designed for teams building complex systems that demand:
    - Continuous functional adaptability
    - High architectural complexity
    - Numerous trade-offs management
    - Scalability and integration requirements
    - Multiple teams working cohesively
    - Regulated environments

    For simpler projects without complex trade-off management, try [specs.md (Simple Flow)](/simple-flow/overview).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Why AI-DLC? (The Agentic Age)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why do we need a new methodology? What's wrong with Agile?">
    Traditional methods were built for longer iteration durations (months and weeks), leading to rituals like daily standups and retrospectives. With AI, iteration cycles are measured in hours or days.

    Retrofitting AI into Agile limits its potential and reinforces outdated inefficiencies. We need automobiles, not faster horse chariots.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are sprints becoming obsolete?">
    - **Two weeks is no longer fast** - AI produces working prototypes in hours
    - **Story points are meaningless** - AI execution time bears no relation to human effort
    - **Sprint boundaries create artificial delays** - Completed work waits for ceremonies
    - **Velocity fluctuates wildly** - Based on AI tool usage, not team capability

    AI-DLC replaces sprints with "Bolts" - hours or days, not weeks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is V-Bounce?">
    V-Bounce is a model from the [Crowdbotics research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03416) that introduced a key insight: humans shift from primary implementers to validators and verifiers.

    AI handles planning, coding, and testing. Humans focus on requirements, architecture, and continuous validation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does 'AI drives, human validates' mean?">
    In traditional development, humans prompt AI to complete tasks. In AI-DLC, the conversation is reversed:

    **Traditional**: Human asks → AI responds

    **AI-DLC**: AI proposes breakdown, trade-offs, designs → Human validates, approves, redirects

    Think of it like Google Maps: you set the destination, AI provides step-by-step directions, you maintain oversight.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are Mob Elaboration and Mob Construction?">
    These are AI-DLC's collaborative rituals:

    - **Mob Elaboration** (Inception): Product managers, developers, QA collaborate with AI to refine requirements into user stories. What took months now takes hours.

    - **Mob Construction** (Construction): Teams work in parallel after domain modeling, with AI generating component models while team provides real-time clarification.

    Both happen in a single room with shared screen for deep alignment.
  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Installation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I install specs.md?">
    ```bash
    npx specsmd@latest install
    ```

    The installer automatically detects your AI coding tools and sets up the appropriate agents.

    [Full installation guide →](/getting-started/installation)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I install globally with npm?">
    No. Always use `npx specsmd@latest install` to ensure you get the latest version. Global installation may result in using an outdated version.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What gets installed?">
    specs.md creates a `.specsmd/` directory with:
    - Agent definitions
    - Skills and capabilities
    - Templates for artifacts
    - Memory bank schema

    It also creates tool-specific files (e.g., `.claude/commands/` for Claude Code).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agents don't seem to remember previous context?">
    Each agent invocation starts fresh. Agents read context from the Memory Bank at startup.

    **Solution**: Ensure artifacts are saved after each step. The Memory Bank is how context persists between sessions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I reset project state?">
    To reset all artifacts, clear the `memory-bank/` directory:
    ```bash
    rm -rf memory-bank/
    ```

    To remove specs.md entirely:
    ```bash
    rm -rf .specsmd/
    rm -rf .claude/commands/specsmd-*  # For Claude Code
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use specs.md with existing Agile workflows?">
    AI-DLC is designed as a reimagination of development methodology, not a retrofit. However, familiar concepts (user stories, acceptance criteria) are retained to ease transition.

    You can use specs.md alongside existing Agile processes, treating Intents as Epics and Bolts as focused work items within sprints.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use specs.md on existing codebases (brownfield)?">
    Yes. AI-DLC supports brownfield development through "model elevation" - AI first converts existing code to semantic models (domain components, responsibilities, relationships) before making changes.

    This ensures AI understands the existing system before proposing modifications.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Methodology

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Intents, Units, and Bolts?">
    - **Intent**: High-level goal ("Build user authentication")
    - **Unit**: Cohesive work element derived from Intent ("User Registration")
    - **Bolt**: Smallest iteration, hours to days ("Registration Domain Model")

    [Learn more about core concepts →](/core-concepts/intents)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the three phases?">
    1. **Inception**: Mob Elaboration ritual - capture intents, decompose into units and stories
    2. **Construction**: Mob Construction ritual - domain modeling, code generation, testing
    3. **Operations**: Deployment, monitoring, maintenance

    [Learn more about phases →](/methodology/three-phases)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are human checkpoints?">
    Human checkpoints are validation points within a bolt. You must approve each stage before proceeding to the next:

    1. Domain Model → **CHECKPOINT** → Technical Design → **CHECKPOINT** → etc.

    This catches errors early before they cascade downstream.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What bolt types are available?">
    | Type | Use Case |
    |------|----------|
    | **DDD Construction** | Complex business logic, domain modeling |
    | **Simple Construction** | UI, integrations, utilities |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the Memory Bank?">
    The Memory Bank is a file-based storage system for all project artifacts. It maintains context across agent sessions and provides traceability between requirements, designs, code, and tests.

    [Learn more about Memory Bank →](/core-concepts/memory-bank)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is DDD (Domain-Driven Design) required?">
    Unlike Agile frameworks that leave design techniques optional, AI-DLC integrates DDD as its core. AI applies domain-driven design principles during decomposition:

    - Bounded contexts
    - Aggregates and entities
    - Domain events
    - Repositories and factories

    This ensures consistent, high-quality domain models regardless of which team member is working.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent commands not recognized">
    Ensure specs.md is installed correctly:
    ```bash
    ls .specsmd/aidlc/agents/
    ```

    If the directory is empty or missing, reinstall:
    ```bash
    npx specsmd@latest install
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Memory Bank artifacts missing">
    Check if the memory-bank directory exists:
    ```bash
    ls memory-bank/
    ```

    If missing, run project initialization:
    ```bash
    /specsmd-master-agent
    > project-init
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Standards not being followed in generated code">
    Ensure standards are defined in `memory-bank/standards/`:
    - `tech-stack.md`
    - `coding-standards.md`
    - `architecture.md`

    If missing or incomplete, use the Master Agent to define them:
    ```bash
    /specsmd-master-agent
    > project-init
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI not following the spec properly">
    This is a known limitation of all spec-driven tools. Even with comprehensive specs, AI agents don't always follow every instruction.

    **Solutions**:
    - Use checkpoints to catch errors early
    - Break work into smaller, clearer units
    - Ensure Memory Bank has complete context
    - Validate each step before proceeding
