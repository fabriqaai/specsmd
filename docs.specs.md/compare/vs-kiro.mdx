description: "Compare specs.md with AWS Kiro IDE"
---

## Overview

**Kiro** is AWS's agentic IDE built on Code OSS (VS Code foundation) with integrated spec-driven development, agent hooks, and deep AWS integration. **To use Kiro's spec-driven features, you must use their paid IDE**—there's no way to use the methodology with your preferred tools.

**specs.md** is an IDE-agnostic framework implementing AWS's AI-DLC methodology. It works with 11+ AI coding tools including Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and more. Your specs and agents are portable markdown files—no vendor lock-in.

<Info>
**Coming Soon**: specs.md (Simple Flow) will provide Kiro-style Requirements → Design → Tasks workflow.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect | specs.md | Kiro |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| **Type** | Framework/CLI | Full IDE |
| **IDE** | Works with any (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Code, etc.) | Kiro IDE only |
| **Workflow** | AI-DLC: Inception → Construction → Operations | Requirements → Design → Tasks |
| **Methodology** | Formal AI-DLC phases and rituals | Kiro SDD workflow |
| **Automation** | Skills + Templates | Agent Hooks + Steering |
| **Context** | Memory Bank (persistent project knowledge) | requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md + steering files |
| **AI Model** | Any (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.) | Claude Sonnet 4.5 + Auto mode |
| **Pricing** | Free (open source) | Free preview → $20/mo (Pro), $39/mo (Pro+), $200/mo (Power) |
| **Spec Format** | Markdown + YAML | EARS notation for requirements |
| **Lock-in** | None | Kiro IDE + Claude only |
| **VS Code Extension** | Yes ([visual dashboard](/getting-started/vscode-extension)) | Built into IDE (limited) |
| **Maturity** | Production-ready | Preview (July 2025) |

  </Card>
  <Card title="Choose Kiro if:" icon="check">
    - You want an all-in-one IDE experience
    - You're heavily invested in AWS ecosystem
    - You want built-in agent hooks for automation
    - You prefer visual spec generation
    - You're okay with Claude Sonnet only
    - You're okay with subscription pricing
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Key Differences

### 1. IDE Lock-in (Paid)

**Kiro**: Requires Kiro IDE subscription ($19-39/month) to use spec-driven features. You cannot use Kiro's methodology in VS Code, Cursor, or other editors.

**specs.md**: Works with **11+ tools** including Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, Roo, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, OpenCode, and more. Your specs are portable markdown files—switch tools anytime.

### 2. AI Model Flexibility

**Kiro**: Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 with an "Auto" mode that mixes frontier models. No option to use GPT, Gemini, or bring your own API key.

**specs.md**: Works with any AI model. Use whichever model works best for your use case.

### 3. Pricing Model

**Kiro** (revised August 2025):
- Free: 50 vibe requests (no spec requests)
- Pro: $20/month (225 vibe, 125 spec requests)
- Pro+: $39/month (450 vibe, 250 spec requests)
- Power: $200/month (2,250 vibe, 1,250 spec requests)

**specs.md**:
- Free (open source)
- Pay only for your AI API tokens

### 4. Context Management

**Kiro** uses simple spec files + steering:
```
.kiro/
├── requirements.md   # Requirements spec
├── design.md         # Design spec
├── tasks.md          # Task breakdown
└── steering/         # Agent steering files
```

**specs.md** uses Memory Bank:
```
memory-bank/
├── context-config.yaml    # Phase-aware context
├── artifacts/             # Persistent artifacts
└── standards/             # Project standards
```

### 5. Automation Approach

**Kiro** uses Agent Hooks (event-driven):
```yaml
# .kiro/hooks/update-tests.yaml
trigger: on_save
pattern: "**/*.tsx"
action: "Update related test file"
```

**specs.md** uses Skills and Templates:
```yaml
# skills/construction/domain-modeling.yaml
name: Domain Modeling
triggers:
  - bolt-start
  - domain-design
actions:
  - Apply DDD principles
  - Generate component model
```
