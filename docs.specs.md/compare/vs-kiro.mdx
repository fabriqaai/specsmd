description: "Compare specs.md (AI-DLC) with AWS Kiro IDE"
---

## Overview

**Kiro** is AWS's agentic IDE built on Code OSS (VS Code foundation) with integrated spec-driven development, agent hooks, and deep AWS integration. **To use Kiro's spec-driven features, you must use their paid IDE**—there's no way to use the methodology with your preferred tools.

**specs.md (AI-DLC)** is an IDE-agnostic framework implementing AWS's AI-DLC methodology. It works with 11+ AI coding tools including Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and more. Your specs and agents are portable markdown files—no vendor lock-in.

<Info>
**Coming Soon**: specs.md (Simple Flow) will provide Kiro-style Requirements → Design → Tasks workflow.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect | specs.md (AI-DLC) | Kiro |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| **Type** | Framework/CLI | Full IDE |
| **IDE** | Works with any (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Code, etc.) | Kiro IDE only |
| **Workflow** | AI-DLC: Inception → Construction → Operations | Requirements → Design → Tasks |
| **Methodology** | Formal AI-DLC phases and rituals | Kiro SDD workflow |
| **Automation** | Skills + Templates | Agent Hooks (event-driven) |
| **Context** | Memory Bank (persistent project knowledge) | Steering Docs (tech.md, structure.md, product.md) |

## Key Differences

### 1. IDE Lock-in (Paid)

**Kiro**: Requires Kiro IDE subscription ($19-39/month) to use spec-driven features. You cannot use Kiro's methodology in VS Code, Cursor, or other editors.

**specs.md (AI-DLC)**: Works with **11+ tools** including Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, Roo, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, OpenCode, and more. Your specs are portable markdown files—switch tools anytime.

### 2. AI Model Flexibility

**Kiro**: Uses Claude Sonnet 4 only. No option to use GPT, Gemini, or other models.

**specs.md (AI-DLC)**: Works with any AI model. Use whichever model works best for your use case.

### 3. Pricing Model

**Kiro**:
- Free preview (limited)
- Pro: $19/month (1,000 agent interactions)
- Pro+: $39/month (3,000 agent interactions)

**specs.md (AI-DLC)**:
- Free (open source)
- Pay only for your AI API tokens

### 4. Context Management

**Kiro** uses Steering Docs:
```
.kiro/
├── tech.md        # Technology stack
├── structure.md   # Project structure
└── product.md     # Product requirements
```

**specs.md (AI-DLC)** uses Memory Bank:
```
memory-bank/
├── context-config.yaml    # Phase-aware context
├── artifacts/             # Persistent artifacts
└── standards/             # Project standards
```

### 5. Automation Approach

**Kiro** uses Agent Hooks (event-driven):
```yaml
# .kiro/hooks/update-tests.yaml
trigger: on_save
pattern: "**/*.tsx"
action: "Update related test file"
```

**specs.md (AI-DLC)** uses Skills and Templates:
```yaml
# skills/construction/domain-modeling.yaml
name: Domain Modeling
triggers:
  - bolt-start
  - domain-design
actions:
  - Apply DDD principles
  - Generate component model
```

**Coming Soon**: specs.md (Simple Flow) will provide Kiro-style Requirements → Design → Tasks workflow.
