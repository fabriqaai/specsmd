## Overview

**GitHub Spec Kit** is a toolkit that provides agent prompts and 7 slash commands (`/speckit.constitution`, `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, `/speckit.analyze`, `/speckit.implement`, `/speckit.clarify`) for 15+ AI coding assistants including Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Gemini CLI.

**specs.md** is a full methodology implementation with phase-based agents, Mob rituals, and DDD integration.

<Info>
**Coming Soon**: specs.md (Simple Flow) will provide Spec Kit-like simple flows for teams wanting a lighter entry point.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect | specs.md | Spec Kit |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **Type** | Full methodology | Toolkit + Agent Prompts |
| **Target** | Complex systems requiring trade-offs | Small-medium projects |
| **Approach** | Structured AI-DLC phases with methodology | 6-phase workflow with agent prompts |
| **Structure** | Intents → Units → Stories | Constitution → Specify → Plan → Tasks → Analyze → Implement |
| **Agent Model** | 3 phase-based agents | Prompts for 15+ AI assistants |
| **Design Integration** | DDD default (extensible via bolt types) | Constitution file |
| **Rituals** | Mob Elaboration, Mob Construction | None |
| **Memory** | Memory Bank (persistent context) | Constitution file + .specify folder |
| **Customization** | Skills, templates, memory bank | Constitution file, scripts, templates |
| **Learning Curve** | Moderate | Low |
| **VS Code Extension** | Yes ([visual dashboard](/getting-started/vscode-extension)) | No |

## Key Differences

### 1. Methodology vs Toolkit

**Spec Kit** is a toolkit—a set of commands that structure your prompts. It doesn't prescribe how you work, just helps you write better specs.

**specs.md** is a full methodology with:
- Defined phases (Inception → Construction → Operations)
- Rituals (Mob Elaboration, Mob Construction)
- Role definitions (AI drives, human validates)
- Artifact specifications (Intents, Units, Bolts)

### 2. Conversation Direction

**Spec Kit**: Agent-driven via structured prompts
```
Human: /speckit.specify [high-level description]
AI: [generates detailed specification with user journeys]
AI: [asks clarifying questions via /speckit.clarify]
Human: [validates and refines]
```

**specs.md**: AI drives with Mob rituals
```
Human: [provides intent]
AI: "I've analyzed your intent. Here are 3 Units I propose.
     I have 5 clarifying questions before we proceed..."
Human: [validates, approves, or redirects in Mob session]
```

### 3. Design Integration

**Spec Kit**: Constitution file sets project principles and constraints. Technical plan phase handles architecture decisions.

**specs.md**: DDD is the default methodology. AI applies domain-driven design principles during decomposition, creating bounded contexts, aggregates, and domain models. Extensible via bolt types for BDD, TDD, or custom flows.

---

## AI-DLC's Opinionated Approach

Unlike toolkit-based approaches, AI-DLC is an opinionated methodology with specific patterns:

**Bolts, Not Sprints**: Instead of 2-week sprints with variable scope, AI-DLC uses Bolts—focused execution units measured in hours or days. Each Bolt batches related stories together and executes them with full DDD construction steps.

**DDD Baked In**: Domain-Driven Design isn't optional—it's integral. Every Bolt follows DDD patterns: domain modeling, bounded contexts, aggregates, and entities. This creates consistent, high-quality designs regardless of who's working.

**Agent Drives, Human Validates**: In AI-DLC, the AI proposes breakdown, trade-offs, and designs. Humans validate and approve. This reversed conversation direction keeps humans in control while leveraging AI's synthesis capabilities.

**Full Traceability**: Artifacts created during construction show exactly what was built and how—from Intent to Unit to Story to Bolt execution.

## Migration Path

If you're currently using Spec Kit and want more structure:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with Simple Flow (Coming Soon)">
    specs.md (Simple Flow) will provide Kiro-style Requirements → Design → Tasks workflow
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Memory Bank">
    Enable persistent context across sessions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adopt Phase Structure">
    Organize work into Inception, Construction, Operations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Graduate to Full AI-DLC">
    When complexity demands it, adopt full Mob rituals and DDD integration
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Summary

| For This Need | Use This |
|---------------|----------|
| Quick spec generation | Spec Kit or specs.md (Simple Flow) |
| Minimal learning curve | Spec Kit |
| Complex system development | specs.md |
| Team coordination | specs.md |
| Enterprise/regulated environments | specs.md |
| DDD integration | specs.md |

<Info>
**Bottom Line**: Spec Kit is great for adding light structure. specs.md is for when you need a complete methodology for complex systems.

*Can't decide? Wait for specs.md (Simple Flow)—start simple, graduate when needed.*
