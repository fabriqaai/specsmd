title: "specs.md vs OpenSpec"
description: "Compare specs.md with OpenSpec's change-centric approach"
---

## Overview

**OpenSpec** is a lightweight, brownfield-first CLI tool focused on change management. It separates current truth (`specs/`) from proposed changes (`changes/`).

**specs.md** is a full lifecycle methodology covering Inception through Operations, with support for both greenfield and brownfield development.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect | specs.md | OpenSpec |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **Primary Focus** | Full lifecycle (Inception → Operations) | Change management |
| **Best For** | Greenfield + brownfield | Greenfield + brownfield (brownfield-focused) |
| **Philosophy** | Complete methodology | Lightweight, change-centric |
| **Structure** | Intents → Units → Stories | Specs + Changes separation |
| **Brownfield Support** | Supported (with model elevation) | Excellent (primary design focus) |
| **Token Efficiency** | Both (Units scope context) | Both (spec deltas) |
| **Design Integration** | DDD as core | Design-agnostic (your choice) |
| **Rituals** | Mob Elaboration, Mob Construction | None |
| **Learning Curve** | Moderate | Low |
| **VS Code Extension** | Yes ([visual dashboard](/getting-started/vscode-extension)) | CLI dashboard |

## When to Choose Each

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Choose specs.md (AI-DLC) if:" icon="check">
    - You need full project lifecycle support
    - You're building new features (greenfield)
    - You want DDD integration
    - You need Mob rituals for team alignment
    - You want formal methodology structure
    - You want a [VS Code extension](/getting-started/vscode-extension) to track progress visually
  </Card>
  <Card title="Choose OpenSpec if:" icon="check">
    - You primarily make incremental changes
    - You're working with existing codebases
    - You want maximum token efficiency
    - You prefer minimal overhead
    - You want the simplest possible setup
    - You make high-volume, small-scope changes
  </Card>

## Key Differences

### 1. Design Philosophy

**OpenSpec**: Brownfield-first. Designed for modifying existing systems with a clear separation between current state and proposed changes.

```
openspec/
├── specs/      # Current truth (what exists)
└── changes/    # Proposed updates (what's changing)
```

**specs.md**: Full lifecycle. Designed for complex systems from inception through operations.

```
memory-bank/
├── intents/           # High-level goals
├── units/             # Decomposed work
├── construction/      # Domain models, code
└── operations/        # Deployment, monitoring
```

### 2. Token Efficiency

**OpenSpec**: Excellent token efficiency. Only sends "spec deltas" (proposed changes) to the LLM, not the full codebase context.

**specs.md**: Memory Bank provides structured context. You can achieve similar change-focused efficiency by creating Units specifically for changes—keeping context scoped to what matters.

| Approach | Token Usage | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| OpenSpec | Lower | High-volume small changes |
| specs.md | Higher | Complex decisions requiring full context |

### 3. Brownfield Handling

**OpenSpec**: Primary design focus. Every change is explicit with clear before/after separation.

**specs.md**: Supported via "model elevation" - AI first converts existing code to semantic models (domain components, relationships) before making changes. *More advanced brownfield process coming soon.*

```
AI-DLC Brownfield Flow:
Existing Code → Semantic Models → Changes → Updated Code
```

### 4. Methodology vs Tool

**OpenSpec**: A tool for managing specs and changes. No prescribed methodology.

**specs.md**: A complete methodology with:
- Defined phases (Inception → Construction → Operations)
- Rituals (Mob Elaboration, Mob Construction)
- Design integration (DDD as core)
- Role definitions (AI drives, human validates)

## Use Case Comparison

| Use Case | OpenSpec | specs.md |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Small bug fix | Excellent | Overkill |
| Feature tweak | Excellent | Good |
| New feature (existing codebase) | Good | Excellent |
| New system (greenfield) | Limited | Excellent |
| Complex refactoring | Good | Excellent |
| Multi-team coordination | Limited | Excellent |

---

## Summary

| For This Need | Use This |
|---------------|----------|
| Brownfield changes | OpenSpec (excellent) or specs.md (good) |
| Greenfield development | specs.md |
| Token efficiency | Both |
| Full lifecycle | specs.md |
| Minimal setup | OpenSpec |
| DDD integration | specs.md |
| Team rituals | specs.md |
| High-volume small changes | OpenSpec |

<Info>
**Bottom Line**: OpenSpec excels at brownfield changes with minimal overhead. specs.md provides full lifecycle support for complex systems.

*For brownfield work within a larger project, consider using both together.*
