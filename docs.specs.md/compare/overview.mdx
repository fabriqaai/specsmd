## specs.md: Reimagine Your Development Flow

<Warning>
**The Main Difference**: specs.md (AI-DLC) is for teams ready to rethink and reimagine their development flows—not just use AI as a copilot for traditional Agile processes.

If you want to keep your existing Agile workflow and add AI assistance, other tools may be a better fit. If you're ready to embrace a new methodology built for the agentic age, specs.md is for you.
</Warning>

specs.md implements AWS's AI-DLC—a methodology specifically designed for complex systems requiring architectural trade-offs, scalability, and multi-team coordination.

<Info>
**Coming Soon**: specs.md (Simple Flow) will provide Spec Kit and Kiro-like simple flows for developers who want a lighter entry point before adopting full AI-DLC workflows.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. AI-DLC is a Formal AWS Methodology

Unlike generic "spec-driven development," AI-DLC is defined by AWS with specific phases, rituals, and artifacts. specs.md is a faithful implementation—not an interpretation.

### 2. DDD as Default, Extensible via Bolt Types

Agile frameworks leave design techniques optional. AI-DLC integrates Domain-Driven Design as its default—AI applies DDD principles during decomposition, developers validate.

**Extensible**: Use bolt types to add other methodologies like BDD, TDD, or model your own construction flow. DDD is the default, not a limitation.

### 3. Bolts: Batched Stories with Full Traceability

Unlike other tools with variable iteration cycles, specs.md uses **Bolts**—planned batches of related stories executed together by an agent. Each Bolt follows DDD steps during execution, and artifacts created during construction provide full traceability of what was built and how.

```
Intent → Units → Stories → Bolt (batched stories)
                              ↓
                    DDD Construction Steps
                              ↓
                    Traceable Artifacts
```

### 4. Reversed Conversation Direction

In AI-DLC, **AI initiates and directs conversations**. AI proposes breakdown, trade-offs, designs. Humans validate and approve. This is the opposite of most tools where humans prompt AI.

### 5. Mob Rituals for Team Alignment

Mob Elaboration (Inception) and Mob Construction condense weeks of sequential work into hours while achieving deep alignment between team and AI.

### 6. Built for Complex Systems

<Warning>
AI-DLC explicitly targets systems with "continuous functional adaptability, high architectural complexity, numerous trade-offs management, scalability, integration and customization requirements."

Simpler projects → specs.md (Simple Flow) coming soon.
