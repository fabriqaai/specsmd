## specs.md: AI-DLC for Complex Systems, Simple Flow for Everything Else

specs.md implements AWS's AI-DLC—a methodology specifically designed for complex systems requiring architectural trade-offs, scalability, and multi-team coordination.

<Info>
**Coming Soon**: specs.md (Simple Flow) will provide Spec Kit and Kiro-like simple flows for developers who want a lighter entry point before adopting full AI-DLC workflows.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. AI-DLC is a Formal AWS Methodology

Unlike generic "spec-driven development," AI-DLC is defined by AWS with specific phases, rituals, and artifacts. specs.md is a faithful implementation—not an interpretation.

### 2. DDD as Default, Extensible via Bolt Types

Agile frameworks leave design techniques optional. AI-DLC integrates Domain-Driven Design as its default—AI applies DDD principles during decomposition, developers validate.

**Extensible**: Use bolt types to add other methodologies like BDD, TDD, or model your own construction flow. DDD is the default, not a limitation.

### 3. Reversed Conversation Direction

In AI-DLC, **AI initiates and directs conversations**. AI proposes breakdown, trade-offs, designs. Humans validate and approve. This is the opposite of most tools where humans prompt AI.

### 4. Mob Rituals for Team Alignment

Mob Elaboration (Inception) and Mob Construction condense weeks of sequential work into hours while achieving deep alignment between team and AI.

### 5. Built for Complex Systems

<Warning>
AI-DLC explicitly targets systems with "continuous functional adaptability, high architectural complexity, numerous trade-offs management, scalability, integration and customization requirements."

Simpler projects → specs.md (Simple Flow) coming soon.
</Warning>

## Roadmap

We're building new capabilities based on your feedback:

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Full AI-DLC** | Available | Complete Inception → Construction → Operations |
| **Simple Flow** | Coming Soon | Kiro-style Requirements → Design → Tasks workflow |
