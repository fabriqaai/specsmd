title: AI-DLC Quick Start
description: Get up and running with AI-DLC flow in minutes

<Warning>
  **Alpha Version**: specs.md does not yet fully support brownfield applications as defined in the AI-DLC process. Currently, it relies on the underlying LLM model's capabilities for existing codebase analysis. Full brownfield support is coming soon.
</Warning>

## Initialize Your Project

Open your AI coding tool and start the Master Agent:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Claude Code">
    ```bash
    /specsmd-master-agent
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cursor">
    ```
    /specsmd-master-agent
    ```
    Or use the `@` prefix:
    ```
    @specsmd-master-agent
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GitHub Copilot">
    ```bash
    /specsmd-master-agent
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Then type:

```
project-init
```

This guides you through establishing:

  <Step title="Coding Standards">
    Formatting, linting, naming, testing strategy
  </Step>
  <Step title="System Architecture">
    Architecture style, API design, state management
  </Step>
  <Step title="UX Guide (Optional)">
    Design system, styling, accessibility
  </Step>
  <Step title="API Conventions (Optional)">
    API style, versioning, response formats
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create Your First Intent

An **Intent** is your high-level goal:

- "User authentication system"
- "Product catalog with search"
- "Payment processing integration"

```bash
/specsmd-inception-agent intent-create
```

The agent will:

1. Ask clarifying questions to minimize ambiguity
2. Elaborate into user stories and NFRs
3. Define system context
4. Decompose into loosely-coupled units

## Plan and Execute Bolts

```bash
# Plan bolts for your stories
/specsmd-inception-agent bolt-plan

# Execute a bolt
/specsmd-construction-agent bolt-start
```

Each bolt goes through validated stages:

<Warning>
  Human validation happens at each checkpoint. This ensures errors are caught early before cascading downstream.
