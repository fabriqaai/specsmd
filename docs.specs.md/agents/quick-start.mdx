title: AI-DLC Quick Start
description: Get up and running with AI-DLC flow in minutes
---

<Warning>
  **Alpha Version**: specs.md does not yet fully support brownfield applications as defined in the AI-DLC process. Currently, it relies on the underlying LLM model's capabilities for existing codebase analysis. Full brownfield support is coming soon.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- An AI coding tool (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- A project to work on (greenfield recommended for AI-DLC)

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install specs.md">
    ```bash
    npx specsmd@latest install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select AI-DLC flow">
    When prompted, select **AI-DLC** as your development flow:
    ```
    ? Select a development flow:
    ❯ AI-DLC - Full methodology with DDD
      FIRE - Adaptive execution, brownfield & monorepo ready
      Simple - Spec generation only
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your AI tool">
    Select your preferred AI coding tool for agent configuration
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Initialize Your Project

Open your AI coding tool and start the Master Agent:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Claude Code">
    ```bash
    /specsmd-master-agent
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cursor">
    ```
    /specsmd-master-agent
    ```
    Or use the `@` prefix:
    ```
    @specsmd-master-agent
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GitHub Copilot">
    ```bash
    /specsmd-master-agent
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Then type:

```
project-init
```

This guides you through establishing:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Tech Stack">
    Languages, frameworks, databases, infrastructure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Coding Standards">
    Formatting, linting, naming, testing strategy
  </Step>
  <Step title="System Architecture">
    Architecture style, API design, state management
  </Step>
  <Step title="UX Guide (Optional)">
    Design system, styling, accessibility
  </Step>
  <Step title="API Conventions (Optional)">
    API style, versioning, response formats
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create Your First Intent

An **Intent** is your high-level goal:

- "User authentication system"
- "Product catalog with search"
- "Payment processing integration"

```bash
/specsmd-inception-agent intent-create
```

The agent will:

1. Ask clarifying questions to minimize ambiguity
2. Elaborate into user stories and NFRs
3. Define system context
4. Decompose into loosely-coupled units

## Plan and Execute Bolts

```bash
# Plan bolts for your stories
/specsmd-inception-agent bolt-plan

# Execute a bolt
/specsmd-construction-agent bolt-start
```

Each bolt goes through validated stages:

<Warning>
  Human validation happens at each checkpoint. This ensures errors are caught early before cascading downstream.

## Command Reference

| Agent | Command | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Master** | `project-init` | Initialize project with standards |
| **Master** | `analyze-context` | View current project state |
| **Inception** | `intent-create` | Create a new intent |
| **Inception** | `bolt-plan` | Plan bolts for stories |
| **Construction** | `bolt-start` | Start/continue executing a bolt |
| **Construction** | `bolt-status` | Check bolt progress |
| **Operations** | `deploy` | Deploy to environment |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent doesn't remember context">
    Agents are stateless—they read artifacts from Memory Bank at startup. Ensure artifacts are saved after each step.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bolt stuck in stage">
    Run `bolt-status` to check current stage. If validation failed, address the feedback and continue with `bolt-start`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Want to restart a bolt">
    Bolts can be replanned with `/specsmd-inception-agent bolt-replan`. This creates a new bolt for the same stories.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multiple intents exist">
    Run `/specsmd-master-agent analyze-context` to see all intents and their status.
  </Accordion>
