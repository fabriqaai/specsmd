description: Captures intents, elaborates requirements, and decomposes into units
---

## Overview

The **Inception Agent** handles the first phase of AI-DLC. It captures your high-level goals (Intents), elaborates them into detailed requirements, and decomposes them into manageable Units.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `intent-create` | Create a new intent |
| `intent-list` | List all intents |
| `requirements` | Elaborate intent requirements |
| `context` | Define system context |
| `units` | Decompose into units |
| `story-create` | Create stories for a unit |
| `bolt-plan` | Plan bolts for stories |
| `review` | Review inception artifacts |

## intent-create

Creates a new intent from your high-level goal:

```
> intent-create
> I want to build a user authentication system
```

The agent will:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Capture Goal">
    Record your high-level intent description
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask Clarifying Questions">
    Minimize ambiguity through targeted questions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Requirements">
    Create user stories and non-functional requirements
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Context">
    Establish system boundaries and constraints
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Session

```
User: intent-create

Inception Agent: What would you like to build?

User: A user authentication system with login, registration, 
and password reset

Inception Agent: I'll help you elaborate this intent. Let me 
ask some clarifying questions:

1. Should users be able to log in with social providers 
   (Google, GitHub)?
2. Do you need multi-factor authentication?
3. What password requirements do you have?
4. How long should sessions last?

User: No social login for now, no MFA, standard password rules, 
sessions should last 24 hours

Inception Agent: Based on your answers, I've generated the 
following requirements...

[Shows generated requirements.md]

Does this look correct? Should I adjust anything?
```

## requirements

Elaborate or refine requirements for an existing intent:

```
> requirements user-authentication
```

Use this to:

- Add new user stories
- Refine acceptance criteria
- Add non-functional requirements
- Update priorities

## context

Define or update system context:

```
> context user-authentication
```

The agent helps you specify:

- What's in scope vs out of scope
- External interfaces
- Technical constraints
- Dependencies

## units

Decompose an intent into units:

```
> units user-authentication
```

The agent will:

1. Analyze requirements and context
2. Identify natural boundaries
3. Propose unit structure
4. Define interfaces between units
5. Map dependencies

### Example Output

```
Intent: User Authentication
├── Unit: User Registration
│   └── Stories: 3
├── Unit: User Login  
│   └── Stories: 2
├── Unit: Password Management
│   └── Stories: 3
└── Unit: Session Management
    └── Stories: 2

Dependencies:
- Login depends on Registration (user must exist)
- Password Management depends on Session (must be logged in)
```

## story-create

Create user stories for a specific unit:

```
> story-create user-authentication/user-registration
```

The agent generates stories with:

- User story format (As a... I want... So that...)
- Acceptance criteria
- Edge cases
- Test scenarios

## bolt-plan

Plan the bolts needed to implement stories:

```
> bolt-plan user-authentication/user-registration
```

The agent:

1. Analyzes stories and their complexity
2. Groups related stories
3. Assigns bolt types (DDD, TDD, BDD)
4. Orders bolts by dependencies
5. Estimates duration

### Example Output

```
Bolt Plan for User Registration:

1. Bolt: Registration Domain Model (DDD Construction)
   - Stories: US-001, US-002
   - Duration: 2-4 hours
   - Stages: Model → Design → Implement → Test

2. Bolt: Email Validation (TDD Construction)  
   - Stories: US-003
   - Duration: 1-2 hours
   - Stages: Test → Implement → Refactor

3. Bolt: Welcome Email (BDD Construction)
   - Stories: US-004
   - Duration: 1-2 hours
   - Stages: Scenario → Implement → Verify
```

## review

Review all inception artifacts for an intent:

```
> review user-authentication
```

The agent checks for:

- Completeness of requirements
- Consistency between artifacts
- Gaps in coverage
- Potential issues

## Workflow

Typical Inception flow:

```
intent-create → requirements → context → units → story-create → bolt-plan → review
```

<Warning>
  Complete each step before moving on. Incomplete inception leads to problems in construction.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific">
    Provide detailed answers to clarifying questions. Vague inputs lead to vague outputs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review Generated Artifacts">
    Always review what the agent generates. Correct errors before moving forward.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep Units Focused">
    If a unit feels too big, ask the agent to split it further.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Plan Before Building">
    Don't skip to Construction. Good bolt plans save time later.
