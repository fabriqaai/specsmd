## What is Simple Flow?

Simple Flow is a lightweight spec-driven development workflow for projects that don't need the full complexity of AI-DLC. It guides you through three phases to transform a feature idea into an actionable implementation plan.

<Info>
**Think of it as**: Kiro-style spec-driven development that works with any AI coding tool—Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and more.
</Info>

## Three Phases

| Phase | Output | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Requirements** | `requirements.md` | Define what to build with user stories and EARS criteria |
| **Design** | `design.md` | Create technical design with architecture and Mermaid diagrams |
| **Tasks** | `tasks.md` | Generate implementation checklist with coding tasks |

One agent (`/specsmd-agent`) guides you through all phases.

## When to Use Simple Flow

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Simple Flow when:" icon="check">
    - Building prototypes or MVPs
    - Working on small-to-medium features
    - Solo or small team projects
    - You want minimal overhead
    - You need quick feature specs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use AI-DLC Flow when:" icon="building">
    - Building complex, multi-team systems
    - You need DDD integration and domain modeling
    - Managing architectural trade-offs
    - Regulated or enterprise environments
    - You want Mob rituals for team alignment

## Key Differences from AI-DLC

| Aspect | Simple Flow | AI-DLC Flow |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Phases** | 3: Requirements → Design → Tasks | 3: Inception → Construction → Operations |
| **Agents** | 1 (Agent) | 4 (Master, Inception, Construction, Operations) |
| **Output** | `specs/` folder with 3 markdown files | Full `memory-bank/` hierarchy |
| **DDD Stages** | Not included | Full DDD stages in Construction |
| **Bolts** | No concept | Time-boxed execution sessions |
| **Hierarchy** | Flat (`specs/{feature}/`) | Nested (intents/units/stories) |
| **Overhead** | Minimal | Significant structure |

---

## Output Structure

Simple Flow creates a clean, flat structure:

```
specs/
└── {feature-name}/
    ├── requirements.md    # What to build
    ├── design.md          # How to build it
    └── tasks.md           # Step-by-step plan
```

No complex memory-bank hierarchy—just specs.

## Core Principles

### Generate First, Ask Later

The agent generates a draft document immediately based on your feature idea. This serves as a starting point for discussion rather than requiring extensive Q&A upfront.

### Explicit Approval Gates

You must explicitly approve each phase before proceeding. Say "yes", "approved", or "looks good" to continue. Any feedback triggers revision.

### One Phase at a Time

The agent focuses on one document per interaction. Complete each phase before moving to the next.

### One Task at a Time

During execution, only one task is implemented per interaction. This allows careful review of each change.

## Graduate to AI-DLC

When your project complexity grows, you can graduate to full AI-DLC:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Simple">
    Use Simple Flow for your initial feature specs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Recognize Complexity">
    When you need DDD, multi-team coordination, or architectural trade-offs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adopt AI-DLC">
    Install AI-DLC flow for full methodology support
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Bottom Line**: Start with Simple Flow, graduate to AI-DLC when complexity demands it.
