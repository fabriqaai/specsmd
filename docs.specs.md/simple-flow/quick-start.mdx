## Installation

```bash
npx specsmd@latest install
```

Select **Simple** when prompted for the SDLC flow.

The installer will:
1. Detect available agentic coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Kiro, etc.)
2. Install the spec agent and skills
3. Set up slash commands for your tools

---

## Your First Spec

### Step 1: Create a New Spec

Open your AI coding tool and invoke the agent:

```
/specsmd-agent Create a todo app with local storage
```

The agent will:
1. Derive a feature name (`todo-app`)
2. Generate a requirements document
3. Ask for your approval

### Step 2: Review Requirements

The agent generates:

```markdown
# Requirements Document

## Introduction
A simple todo application that allows users to manage their daily tasks...

## Glossary
- **Todo_System**: The complete todo application
- **Task**: A single todo item with description and completion status
- **Task_List**: The collection of all tasks

## Requirements

### Requirement 1
**User Story:** As a user, I want to add new tasks...

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN user types a task and presses Enter, THE Todo_System SHALL create a new task
2. WHEN user attempts to add empty task, THE Todo_System SHALL prevent addition
```

**To approve:** Say "yes", "approved", or "looks good"

**To revise:** Provide specific feedback

### Step 3: Review Design

After approval, the agent generates a technical design:

```markdown
# Design Document

## Overview
The todo application uses a simple client-side architecture...

## Architecture
[Mermaid diagram]

## Components
- TaskInput: Handles new task creation
- TaskList: Renders all tasks
- TaskItem: Individual task with actions

## Data Models
interface Task {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  completed: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### Step 4: Review Tasks

After design approval:

```markdown
# Implementation Tasks

- [ ] 1. Set up project structure
  _Requirements: Setup_

- [ ] 2. Create Task data model
  - [ ] 2.1 Define Task interface
  - [ ] 2.2 Add validation
  _Requirements: 1.1_

- [ ] 3. Checkpoint - Verify tests pass

- [ ] 4. Implement TaskInput component
  _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_
```

### Step 5: Execute Tasks

Once tasks are approved:

```
/specsmd-agent What's the next task?
```

The agent executes one task, then waits for your review.

## Tips for Success

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific with your feature idea">
    **Good**: "User auth with email/password and session management"

    **Too vague**: "Login feature"

    The more specific you are, the better the generated specs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review checkpoints">
    Checkpoint tasks run the test suite. Don't skip them—they catch issues early.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="One task at a time (default)">
    By default, the agent stops after each task for your review. If you're comfortable with the progress, you can ask it to continue until all tasks are complete.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent doesn't remember context">
    The agent is stateless—it reads spec files at startup. Ensure documents are saved after each step.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multiple specs exist">
    Run `/specsmd-agent` without arguments to see all specs and choose which to work on.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Want to start over">
    Delete the spec folder:
    ```bash
    rm -rf specs/{feature-name}
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Input too vague">
    If your feature idea is too vague, the agent will ask a clarifying question before generating. Provide more specific details.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
