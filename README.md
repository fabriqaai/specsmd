## Three Flows, Every Use Case

| Flow | Optimized For | Agents | Checkpoints |
|------|---------------|--------|-------------|
| **[Simple](#simple-flow)** | Spec generation, prototypes | 1 | 3 (phase gates) |
| **[FIRE](#fire-flow)** | Adaptive execution, brownfield, monorepos | 3 | Adaptive (0-2) |
| **[AI-DLC](#ai-dlc-flow)** | Full traceability, DDD, regulated environments | 4 | Comprehensive |

> **Not sure which flow?** If you want quick specs without execution tracking, use **Simple**. If you want adaptive execution that right-sizes rigor, use **FIRE**. If you need comprehensive documentation and DDD, use **AI-DLC**.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- An AI coding tool (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or Google Antigravity)

### Installation

> [!NOTE]
> Always use npx to get the latest version. Do not install globally with npm.

```bash
npx specsmd@latest install
```

During installation, select your flow:

```
? Select a development flow:
  Simple - Spec generation only (requirements, design, tasks)
❯ FIRE - Adaptive execution, brownfield & monorepo ready
  AI-DLC - Full methodology with DDD (comprehensive checkpoints)
```

The installer detects your AI coding tools and sets up agent definitions, slash commands, and project structure for your selected flow.

### Install VS Code Extension (Optional)

Track your progress visually with our sidebar extension:
- [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabriqaai.specsmd) — VS Code, GitHub Codespaces
- [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/fabriqaai/specsmd) — Cursor, Windsurf, Amazon Kiro, Google Antigravity

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check the manifest
cat .specsmd/manifest.yaml

# List installed agents (adjust path for your flow)
ls .specsmd/fire/agents/     # FIRE flow
ls .specsmd/simple/agents/   # Simple flow
ls .specsmd/aidlc/agents/    # AI-DLC flow
```

---

## Simple Flow

**Spec generation only.** Generate requirements, design, and task documents without execution tracking.

```
/specsmd-agent
```

**Three Phases:**
1. **Requirements** → `requirements.md` - User stories, EARS criteria
2. **Design** → `design.md` - Technical design, architecture diagrams
3. **Tasks** → `tasks.md` - Implementation checklist

**Best for:** Prototypes, MVPs, spec handoff, projects that don't need AI-assisted execution.

**Output structure:**
```
specs/
└── {feature-name}/
    ├── requirements.md
    ├── design.md
    └── tasks.md
```

---

## FIRE Flow

**Fast Intent-Run Engineering.** Adaptive execution with brownfield and monorepo support. Ships in hours with 0-2 checkpoints based on task complexity.

```
/fire-orchestrator   # Entry point, routing
/fire-planner        # Intent capture, work item decomposition
/fire-builder        # Run execution, walkthrough generation
```

**Key Features:**
- **Adaptive checkpoints** - Autopilot (0), Confirm (1), or Validate (2) based on complexity
- **First-class brownfield** - Auto-detects existing patterns and conventions
- **Monorepo support** - Hierarchical standards with module-specific overrides
- **Walkthrough generation** - Documents every change automatically

**Best for:** Teams who hate friction, brownfield projects, monorepos.

**Output structure:**
```
.specs-fire/
├── state.yaml           # Central state tracking
├── standards/           # Project standards
├── intents/             # Intent documentation
├── runs/                # Run logs
└── walkthroughs/        # Generated documentation
```

## AI-DLC Flow

**Full methodology.** Implements the [AI-Driven Development Lifecycle](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/ai-driven-development-life-cycle/) with Domain-Driven Design and comprehensive traceability.

```
/specsmd-master-agent       # Orchestrates & navigates
/specsmd-inception-agent    # Requirements, stories, bolt planning
/specsmd-construction-agent # Execute bolts through DDD stages
/specsmd-operations-agent   # Deploy, verify, monitor
```

**Three Sequential Phases:**
1. **Inception** - Capture intents, elaborate requirements, decompose into units
2. **Construction** - Execute bolts: Model → Design → ADR → Implement → Test
3. **Operations** - Deploy, verify, and monitor

**Best for:** Complex domains, multi-team coordination, regulated environments.

**Output structure:**
```
memory-bank/
├── standards/           # Project standards
├── intents/             # Intent documentation
│   └── {intent-name}/
│       ├── requirements.md
│       ├── system-context.md
│       └── units/
├── bolts/               # Bolt execution records
└── operations/          # Deployment context
```

## Why specs.md?

### Three Flows for Every Use Case
From quick specs (Simple) to adaptive execution (FIRE) to full methodology (AI-DLC). Choose the flow that matches your project needs.

### Adaptive Checkpoints (FIRE)
Right-sizes the rigor. Simple bug fixes burn through fast. Critical changes get design review. You configure your autonomy preference.

### First-Class Brownfield & Monorepo (FIRE)
Auto-detects existing patterns and respects your conventions. Hierarchical standards with module-specific overrides.

### Full DDD Methodology (AI-DLC)
Domain-Driven Design is integral to Construction, not an optional add-on. Every decision documented with full traceability.

### Tool Agnostic
Works with Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and other AI coding assistants. Markdown-based agents work anywhere—no vendor lock-in.

### Context Engineering
Structured artifacts provide persistent context for AI agents. Agents reload context each session—no more lost knowledge.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Agent commands not recognized</strong></summary>

Ensure specs.md is installed correctly:
```bash
# Check for your flow
ls .specsmd/fire/agents/     # FIRE
ls .specsmd/simple/agents/   # Simple
ls .specsmd/aidlc/agents/    # AI-DLC
```

If the directory is empty or missing, reinstall:
```bash
npx specsmd@latest install
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Project artifacts missing</strong></summary>

Check if the artifacts directory exists for your flow:
```bash
ls .specs-fire/    # FIRE flow
ls specs/          # Simple flow
ls memory-bank/    # AI-DLC flow
```

If missing, initialize your project using the appropriate agent.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Standards not being followed in generated code</strong></summary>

Ensure standards are defined in your flow's standards directory:
- FIRE: `.specs-fire/standards/`
- AI-DLC: `memory-bank/standards/`

Run project initialization if missing.
</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>FAQ</h2></summary>

**Q: Which flow should I choose?**
- **Simple**: Spec generation only, no execution tracking
- **FIRE**: Adaptive execution, brownfield/monorepo support
- **AI-DLC**: Full methodology with DDD and comprehensive traceability

**Q: Can I switch flows after installation?**
Flows are independent—they're not an upgrade path. Each is designed for different use cases. You can reinstall to change flows, but artifacts are structured differently.

**Q: Agents don't seem to remember previous context?**
Each agent invocation starts fresh. Agents read context from artifacts at startup. Ensure artifacts are saved after each step.

**Q: How do I reset project state?**
Delete the artifacts directory for your flow:
- FIRE: `.specs-fire/`
- Simple: `specs/`
- AI-DLC: `memory-bank/`

To remove specsmd entirely, also delete `.specsmd/` and tool-specific command files.

**Q: What project types is this suited for?**
specs.md supports everything from quick prototypes (Simple) to complex enterprise systems (AI-DLC). Choose the flow that matches your project needs.
