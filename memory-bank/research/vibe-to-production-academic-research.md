## Executive Summary

This research addresses the core challenge for specs.md: **How to transform vibe-coded prototypes into production-quality software while preserving domain knowledge, without the risk of AI regeneration drift.**

### The Core Problem

When converting vibe-coded prototypes to AI-DLC specifications:

1. **Non-determinism Risk**: Studies show 75% variance in LLM code generation outputs
2. **Knowledge Preservation**: Tech stack, UX flows, domain objects, and business logic must transfer
3. **Regeneration Drift**: Specs regenerated from different models/tools may produce fundamentally different code
4. **Brownfield Challenge**: Existing codebases need incremental adoption, not greenfield rewrites

### Key Finding

Academic research validates this concern: **"Setting temperature to 0 does not guarantee determinism in code generation"** (Ouyang et al., 2024). The solution requires **anchoring mechanisms** beyond specifications alone.

---

## 5 Recommended Options

### Option 1: Specification-First with Symbolic Anchoring

**Approach**: Extract formal specifications from vibe-coded prototypes using LLMs, then use **symbolic execution** to create deterministic behavioral anchors.

**Academic Foundation**:

- **AutoSpec** (arXiv:2404.00762) achieves 79% automated verification through specification synthesis
- **Symbolic Clustering** (arXiv:2502.11620) enables precise functional equivalence checking
- **SpecRover/SpecGen** (arXiv:2408.02232, arXiv:2401.08807) for code intent extraction

**How It Works**:

```text
Vibe-Coded Prototype
        ↓
[1] LLM extracts specifications (AutoSpec approach)
        ↓
[2] Symbolic execution generates behavioral traces
        ↓
[3] Traces become "golden anchors" for regeneration
        ↓
[4] Any regenerated code must pass symbolic equivalence check
        ↓
Production Code (verified equivalent)
```text

**Pros**:

- Mathematically verifiable equivalence
- Addresses non-determinism directly
- Works for "ditch prototype" path

**Cons**:

- Symbolic execution has scalability limits
- May not capture all behavioral nuances
- Requires formal methods expertise

**Best For**: Critical systems where behavioral equivalence must be provable

---

### Option 2: Test-Contract Driven Migration (Golden Test Anchoring)

**Approach**: Generate comprehensive "golden tests" from the running prototype that serve as behavioral contracts. Any regenerated code must pass all golden tests.

**Academic Foundation**:

- **FreshBrew** (arXiv:2510.04852) validates migrations through 3 sequential gates: compilation → original tests pass → coverage preservation
- **Test-Driven Development for Code Generation** (arXiv:2402.13521) - TDD principles for LLM verification
- **HyClone** (arXiv:2508.01357) combines LLM understanding with execution-based validation

**How It Works**:

```text
Vibe-Coded Prototype
        ↓
[1] Dynamic analysis captures runtime behaviors (InspectCoder approach)
        ↓
[2] Generate exhaustive golden test suite from actual execution
        ↓
[3] Extract specifications as documentation (not primary anchor)
        ↓
[4] Regenerate code from specs
        ↓
[5] Validate against golden tests (3-gate validation)
        ↓
Production Code (behaviorally verified)
```text

**FreshBrew 3-Gate Validation**:

1. **Gate 1**: Successful compilation
2. **Gate 2**: Pass all original tests
3. **Gate 3**: Test coverage within 5% of baseline

**Pros**:

- Practical and executable validation
- Works across different AI models/tools
- Captures actual runtime behavior
- Supports "build on prototype" path

**Cons**:

- Test coverage may miss edge cases
- Tests capture "what is" not "what should be"
- May preserve bugs from prototype

**Best For**: Teams wanting practical validation with existing testing infrastructure

---

### Option 3: Hybrid Strangler Fig with AI Validation

**Approach**: Keep the vibe-coded prototype running while incrementally replacing components with spec-driven modules, using **semantic clone detection** to ensure functional equivalence.

**Academic Foundation**:

- **Strangler Fig Pattern** (AWS, Microsoft architecture patterns)
- **HyClone** (arXiv:2508.01357) - LLM + execution validation for semantic clone detection
- **Legacy Code Modernization** (arXiv:2411.14971, arXiv:2407.04017)
- **Migrating Code at Scale** (arXiv:2504.09691) - Google's approach with TRANSAGENT

**How It Works**:

```text
Vibe-Coded Prototype (Running in Production)
        ↓
[1] Identify bounded context for migration
        ↓
[2] Extract specs for that component only
        ↓
[3] Generate new implementation from specs
        ↓
[4] Run both implementations in parallel (shadow mode)
        ↓
[5] Semantic clone detection validates equivalence
        ↓
[6] Route traffic to new implementation
        ↓
[7] Repeat for next component
        ↓
Production (Incrementally Migrated)
```text

**Key Insight from Google Paper**:
> "UniTrans uses test-cases as a benchmark and to guide code translation"

**Pros**:

- Zero downtime migration
- Rollback capability at any point
- Incremental risk management
- Ideal for brownfield projects

**Cons**:

- Longer migration timeline
- Operational complexity (running two systems)
- May never complete migration

**Best For**: Production systems that cannot afford downtime or risk

---

### Option 4: Knowledge Graph Preservation Architecture

**Approach**: Build a **semantic knowledge graph** of domain objects, business logic flows, and UX patterns from the vibe-coded prototype. Use this graph as a generation anchor rather than text specifications.

**Academic Foundation**:

- **RepoGraph** - Repository-level code graph for AI software engineering
- **RefExpo** (arXiv:2407.02620) - Dependency graph extraction
- **CodeKGC** (arXiv:2304.09048) - Knowledge graph construction from code
- **Knowledge-Based Multi-Agent Framework** (arXiv:2503.20536) for architecture design

**How It Works**:

```text
Vibe-Coded Prototype
        ↓
[1] Static analysis extracts code structure (RefExpo)
        ↓
[2] Build knowledge graph of:
    - Domain entities & relationships
    - Business logic flows
    - UX interaction patterns
    - API contracts
    - Data schemas
        ↓
[3] Graph becomes "domain anchor" (not just text specs)
        ↓
[4] Generate specs FROM the graph (structured, not free-form)
        ↓
[5] Regenerate code with graph as context injection
        ↓
[6] Validate regenerated code against graph constraints
        ↓
Production Code (Graph-Anchored)
```text

**Key Insight from RefExpo**:
> "Nodes can be methods, classes, files, modules. Logical dependencies are identified by how each component references others."

**Pros**:

- Captures structural relationships, not just behavior
- Graph provides deterministic anchoring
- Supports both "ditch" and "build on" paths
- Natural fit for DDD-based AI-DLC

**Cons**:

- Requires graph database infrastructure
- Complex implementation
- May miss dynamic behaviors

**Best For**: Complex domain-driven projects with rich entity relationships

---

### Option 5: Multi-Agent Orchestrated Transformation (MAOT)

**Approach**: Use a **specialized multi-agent system** where different agents handle extraction, specification, generation, and validation—with explicit human validation gates at each stage.

**Academic Foundation**:

- **Self-Organized Agents (SoA)** (arXiv:2404.02183) - Scalable multi-agent code generation
- **Codelevate** (arXiv:2511.07257) - Bridging prototype-production gap with MASA
- **LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems for SE** (arXiv:2404.04834) - Survey of approaches
- **Seeking Specifications** (arXiv:2504.21061) - LLMs distinguish implemented vs intended behavior

**How It Works**:

```text
Vibe-Coded Prototype
        ↓
[Extractor Agent]
- Analyzes codebase structure
- Identifies domain boundaries
- Extracts behavioral patterns
        ↓
[Specification Agent]
- Generates AI-DLC specs from extraction
- Distinguishes implemented vs intended (per arXiv:2504.21061)
- Human validates/modifies specs
        ↓
[Generator Agent]
- Produces new implementation from specs
- Multiple generation attempts with diversity
        ↓
[Validator Agent]
- Runs golden test suites
- Performs semantic equivalence checks
- Human validates final output
        ↓
[Arbiter Agent]
- Selects best generation
- Documents deviations
- Coordinates rollback if needed
        ↓
Production Code (Multi-Validated)
```text

**Key Insight from Codelevate**:
> "Structured multi-agent frameworks emphasize role specialization and modularity, ensuring each agent operates with clear and coordinated purpose."

**Key Insight from "Seeking Specifications"**:
> "LLMs with advanced reasoning capabilities were resilient against the implementation-versus-intent problem—almost always able to identify bugs and target intended behavior."

**Pros**:

- Multiple validation layers
- Explicit human-AI collaboration points
- Scales with Self-Organized Agents approach
- Natural fit for specsmd multi-agent architecture

**Cons**:

- Highest implementation complexity
- Coordination overhead
- Requires robust agent orchestration

**Best For**: Enterprise-scale transformations requiring auditability and governance

## The Non-Determinism Problem: Deep Dive

### Evidence from Research

**"An Empirical Study of the Non-determinism of ChatGPT in Code Generation"** (arXiv:2308.02828, ACM TOSEM 2024)

Key findings:

- **75.76%** of CodeContests tasks produced different outputs across requests
- **51.00%** variance on APPS benchmark
- **47.56%** variance on HumanEval
- **Setting temperature=0 does NOT guarantee determinism**
- cuDNN benchmarking feature introduces hardware-level non-determinism

### Implications for specs.md

1. **Specs alone are insufficient** - Text specifications will be interpreted differently by different models
2. **Need deterministic anchors** - Tests, traces, or graphs that constrain regeneration
3. **Model versioning matters** - Same prompt on model version N vs N+1 produces different code
4. **Tool-agnostic approach required** - Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot may all generate differently

### Mitigation Strategies from Research

| Strategy | Source | Effectiveness |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Greedy decoding (T=0) | arXiv:2511.07585 | Partial - not sufficient alone |
| Symbolic clustering | arXiv:2502.11620 | High - precise functional equivalence |
| Execution-based validation | arXiv:2508.01357 | High - validates actual behavior |
| RAG with code consistency | arXiv:2502.00611 | Medium - improves consistency |
| Consensus generation | arXiv:2307.01898 | High - 100% consensus possible with beam search |

## Brownfield Integration: Special Considerations

### Research Insights

**"Contemporary Software Modernization: Perspectives and Challenges"** (arXiv:2407.04017)

> "When the legacy system has a high business value, it is a candidate for modernization by re-engineering or migration, independently of its internal quality."

**Key challenges for brownfield AI-DLC adoption**:

1. Understanding existing architecture without documentation
2. Preserving knowledge embedded in legacy code
3. Incremental adoption without disrupting operations
4. Managing technical debt during transformation

### Recommended Approach for Brownfield

Combine **Option 3 (Strangler)** with **Option 2 (Test-Contract)**:

1. Generate golden tests from running brownfield system
2. Identify bounded context for first migration
3. Extract specs for that context
4. Generate new implementation
5. Validate with golden tests
6. Shadow deploy and compare
7. Cut over when validated
8. Repeat for next context
