# Unit Brief: Artifact Parser

## Purpose

Parse memory-bank directory structure and artifact files to build a model of AI-DLC artifacts with their statuses. This is the foundation unit that other units depend on for understanding the memory-bank content.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Central `MemoryBankSchema` class with hardcoded paths (future: dynamic from memory-bank.yaml)
- Directory scanning for intents, units, stories, bolts, standards
- YAML frontmatter parsing from markdown files
- Status extraction and normalization
- Project detection (is this a specsmd project?)
- Graceful handling of missing/malformed files

### Out of Scope

- File system watching (handled by file-watcher unit)
- Tree view rendering (handled by sidebar-provider unit)
- File modification/creation

## Dependencies

### Depends On

| Unit | Reason |
|------|--------|
| None | Foundation unit |

### Depended By

| Unit | Reason |
|------|--------|
| sidebar-provider | Needs parsed artifact data |
| file-watcher | Needs to re-parse on changes |
| welcome-view | Needs project detection |

### External Dependencies

| System | Purpose | Risk |
|--------|---------|------|
| Node.js fs | File system access | Low |
| js-yaml | YAML frontmatter parsing | Low |

---

## Technical Context

### Suggested Technology

- TypeScript classes for models
- js-yaml for frontmatter parsing
- VS Code workspace API for paths
- Glob patterns for file discovery

### Integration Points

| Integration | Type | Protocol |
|-------------|------|----------|
| VS Code workspace | API | vscode.workspace |
| File System | API | Node.js fs/promises |

### Data Storage

| Data | Type | Volume | Retention |
|------|------|--------|-----------|
| In-memory models | TypeScript objects | Small (<1MB) | Session |

## Constraints

- Must be synchronous-friendly for initial load (or fast async)
- Must handle 100+ artifacts without performance issues
- Must not throw on malformed files (graceful degradation)

---

## Success Criteria

### Functional

- [ ] MemoryBankSchema defines all paths in one place
- [ ] detectProject correctly identifies specsmd projects
- [ ] All artifact types parsed correctly (intents, units, stories, bolts, standards)
- [ ] Frontmatter parsing extracts status fields
- [ ] Malformed files return "unknown" status, not errors
- [ ] Bolt dependencies parsed (requires_bolts, enables_bolts)
- [ ] isBlocked computed correctly for pending bolts
- [ ] blockedBy list computed for blocked bolts
- [ ] unblocksCount computed for queue prioritization
- [ ] Activity feed derived from bolt timestamps
- [ ] Activity events sorted by timestamp descending

### Non-Functional

- [ ] Parse 100 artifacts in < 200ms
- [ ] No memory leaks from repeated parsing
- [ ] Dependency computation O(n) complexity

### Quality

- [ ] Unit tests for all parsing functions
- [ ] Unit tests for dependency computation
- [ ] Unit tests for activity feed derivation
- [ ] Test fixtures for valid/invalid frontmatter
- [ ] Code coverage > 80%

## Bolt Suggestions

| Bolt | Type | Stories | Objective | Status |
|------|------|---------|-----------|--------|
| bolt-artifact-parser-1 | Simple | 001, 002, 003, 004 | Core parsing functionality | Complete |
| bolt-artifact-parser-2 | Simple | 005, 006 | Dependency parsing and activity derivation | Complete |

---

## Notes

- MemoryBankSchema should be designed with dependency injection in mind for future dynamic loading
- Consider caching parsed results to avoid re-parsing unchanged files
- Status normalization should handle variations (e.g., "completed" vs "complete")
