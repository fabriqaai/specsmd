# Unit Brief: Sidebar Provider

## Purpose

Implement VS Code WebviewViewProvider to render a tabbed sidebar with three views: Bolts (command center), Specs (tree hierarchy), and Overview (metrics dashboard). Handle all visual presentation, user interactions, and state management for the sidebar UI.

## Scope

### In Scope

- WebviewViewProvider implementation for tabbed sidebar
- **Bolts Tab (Command Center)**:
  - Current Intent header with bolt statistics
  - Current Focus expandable card with progress ring, stage pipeline, stories
  - Up Next queue with dependency-ordered pending bolts
  - Recent Activity section with filter and resize handle
- **Specs Tab (Tree View)**:
  - Intent → Unit → Story hierarchy
  - Progress indicators (ring charts)
  - Filter by status
  - Expand/collapse support
- **Overview Tab (Dashboard)**:
  - Overall progress metrics
  - Intents list with progress
  - Active bolts summary
- Status icon display (gray/yellow/green/red for blocked)
- Bolt type badges (DDD, Simple)
- Theme support (dark/light)
- State persistence (active tab, expanded nodes, activity height)
- Tree refresh on data changes

### Out of Scope

- File parsing (handled by artifact-parser)
- File watching (handled by file-watcher)
- Command handling (handled by extension-core)
- Welcome view (handled by welcome-view)

## Dependencies

### Depends On

| Unit | Reason |
|------|--------|
| artifact-parser | Gets parsed artifact data |
| file-watcher | Subscribes to refresh events |

### Depended By

| Unit | Reason |
|------|--------|
| extension-core | Registers provider |

### External Dependencies

| System | Purpose | Risk |
|--------|---------|------|
| VS Code TreeView API | Tree rendering | Low |
| VS Code Webview API | Logo footer | Low |

---

## Technical Context

### Suggested Technology

- vscode.WebviewViewProvider interface
- HTML/CSS/JS for webview content
- VS Code CSS variables for theming
- PostMessage API for webview ↔ extension communication
- VS Code workspaceState for persistence

### Integration Points

| Integration | Type | Protocol |
|-------------|------|----------|
| VS Code WebviewView | API | WebviewViewProvider |
| artifact-parser | Import | TypeScript |
| file-watcher | Event | Callback/EventEmitter |
| extension-core | Commands | VS Code commands |

### Data Storage

| Data | Type | Volume | Retention |
|------|------|--------|-----------|
| UI state | In-memory | Small | Session |
| Tab/expand state | workspaceState | Tiny | Persistent |
| Activity height | workspaceState | Tiny | Persistent |

---

## Constraints

- Must use WebviewViewProvider for tabbed interface (TreeView doesn't support tabs)
- Must use VS Code CSS variables for proper theme support
- Webview content must be secure (CSP headers, nonce for scripts)
- Must handle webview disposal and re-creation gracefully
- Activity panel resize must feel native (smooth, responsive)

---

## Success Criteria

### Functional

- [ ] Three tabs display and switch correctly
- [ ] Bolts tab shows command center layout
- [ ] Current Focus card displays active bolt with progress ring
- [ ] Stage pipeline shows all stages with correct status
- [ ] Up Next queue orders bolts by dependency priority
- [ ] Blocked bolts show blocker indication
- [ ] Activity feed displays events with correct formatting
- [ ] Activity filter works (All/Stages/Bolts)
- [ ] Activity panel resizable with drag handle
- [ ] Specs tab shows Intent → Unit → Story tree
- [ ] Overview tab shows aggregate metrics
- [ ] Tab state persists across sessions
- [ ] Expand/collapse state persists
- [ ] Theme switching works (dark/light)
- [ ] UI refreshes on file changes

### Non-Functional

- [ ] Initial render < 300ms
- [ ] Tab switch < 100ms
- [ ] Smooth resize animations (60fps)
- [ ] Proper theme variable usage

### Quality

- [ ] Unit tests for render functions
- [ ] Unit tests for state management
- [ ] Visual regression tests (screenshots)
- [ ] Code coverage > 80%
