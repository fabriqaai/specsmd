# Intent: Terminal Dashboard

## Overview

Provide a terminal-based dashboard accessible via `npx @specs.md/specsmd` that displays the current state of a specsmd project folder, including installed flows, memory bank status, active bolts, intent progress, and more.

---

## Research Summary

### Terminal UI Libraries Evaluated

| Library | Type | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|---------|------|------|------|----------------|
| **Ink** | React-based | Modern, familiar React patterns, TypeScript support, actively maintained | Requires React knowledge, Yoga layout engine | **Recommended** |
| **Blessed** | Curses-like | Feature-rich, extensive widgets, large ecosystem | Unmaintained, older API | Not recommended |
| **react-blessed** | React + Blessed | React DX with Blessed widgets | Depends on unmaintained Blessed | Not recommended |
| **Chalk + raw** | Manual | Minimal dependencies, full control | Complex layout management | For simple output only |

### Recommended Approach: Ink

Ink is the recommended choice because:

- React component model is familiar to most developers
- Flexbox layout via Yoga makes complex dashboards manageable
- Actively maintained with good TypeScript support
- Used by Shopify CLI, Blitz, and other production CLIs
- Easy to build interactive elements (navigation, input)

## Problem Statement

Currently, users have no quick way to understand the state of their specsmd project:

- What flow is installed?
- Which tools are configured?
- How many intents exist and their status?
- What bolts are active or completed?
- Is the memory bank properly initialized?

Users must manually inspect YAML files and folder structures to understand project state.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Project Detection

- FR-1.1: System SHALL detect if current directory is a specsmd project (has `.specsmd/manifest.yaml`)
- FR-1.2: System SHALL display helpful message if not in a specsmd project

### FR-3: Intent Summary

- FR-3.1: System SHALL list all intents with their names and status
- FR-3.2: System SHALL indicate which intent is currently active (if any)

### FR-5: Standards Status

- FR-5.1: System SHALL indicate if standards are defined
- FR-5.2: System SHALL list defined standard categories (tech-stack, architecture, etc.)

### FR-6: Interactive Navigation (Phase 2)

- FR-6.1: System SHALL support keyboard navigation between sections
- FR-6.2: System SHALL support drilling down into intent details
- FR-6.3: System SHALL support viewing bolt details
- FR-6.4: System SHALL support quick actions (e.g., start new bolt)

### FR-7: Quick Info Mode

- FR-7.1: System SHALL support `--json` flag for machine-readable output
- FR-7.2: System SHALL support `--compact` flag for minimal output
- FR-7.3: System SHALL exit cleanly on `q` or `Ctrl+C`

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance

- Dashboard SHALL render initial view in under 500ms
- File scanning SHALL be lazy/incremental where possible
- Memory usage SHALL stay under 50MB

### NFR-2: Compatibility

- Dashboard SHALL work on macOS, Linux, and Windows terminals
- Dashboard SHALL handle narrow terminal widths gracefully (min 80 columns)
- Dashboard SHALL use ASCII fallbacks when Unicode not supported

### NFR-3: User Experience

- Dashboard SHALL use colors consistent with specs.md branding
- Dashboard SHALL be readable in both light and dark terminal themes
- Dashboard SHALL provide clear visual hierarchy

### NFR-4: Accessibility

- Dashboard SHALL work without colors (via `--no-color` flag or `NO_COLOR` env)
- Dashboard SHALL be navigable via keyboard only

## Command Interface

```bash
# Main dashboard (interactive)
npx @specs.md/specsmd

# JSON output (for scripting)
npx @specs.md/specsmd --json

# Compact output (quick glance)
npx @specs.md/specsmd --compact

# Specific section only
npx @specs.md/specsmd --section=intents
npx @specs.md/specsmd --section=bolts
npx @specs.md/specsmd --section=standards
```
