# AI-DLC Approval Gates Proposal

Proposal to reduce approval gates from 20 to 12 (40% reduction) using Option C: Keep skills, simplify agents.

**Related**: See `archive/approval-gates-analysis.md` for original problem analysis.

---

## Summary

| Metric | Current | Proposed | Change |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| Total gates | 20 | 12 | -40% |
| Inception gates | 7 | 4 | -43% |
| Construction gates (2 bolts) | 9 | 4 | -56% |
| Operations gates | 4 | 4 | 0% |

---

## Proposed Gate Summary

| Phase | Current | Proposed | Reduction |
|-------|---------|----------|-----------|
| Master | 0 | 0 | - |
| Inception | 7 | 4 | -3 |
| Construction (per bolt) | 5 | 2 | -3 |
| Operations | 4 | 4 | 0 |
| **Total (2 bolts)** | **20** | **12** | **-8 (40%)** |

---

## Architecture: Option C (Testable Skills)

### Current (3 layers, implicit gates)

```text
agent-base.md (shared behavior - implicit gates)
    ↓ inherited by
agents/*.md (persona, workflow outline)
    ↓ calls
skills/*/*.md (detailed steps, has own gates)
```

### Proposed (2 layers, explicit gates)

```text
agents/*.md (lightweight: persona + skill routing)
    ↓ calls
skills/*/*.md (complete behavior + explicit GATE markers)
```

**Key Changes**:

1. Delete `agent-base.md`
2. Agents become lightweight routers (persona + skill menu)
3. Skills define complete behavior including explicit GATE markers
4. Skills are testable units

## Key Changes

1. **Requirements first**: Generate Requirements separately with dedicated review (foundational)
2. **Inception batching**: After Requirements approved, batch Context + Units + Stories + Bolt Plan
3. **Construction batching**: Domain + Logical design together, single review
4. **Auto-validation**: If tests pass, skip code review gate
5. **Progress display**: Show checklist at each gate so user knows where they are
6. **Operations unchanged**: Deployment gates are safety-critical, keep all 4

## Implementation Plan (Option C)

| Phase | Task | Files | Effort |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Delete agent-base.md | 1 | Low |
| 2 | Remove agent-base reference from all agents | 4 | Low |
| 3 | Add explicit GATE markers to skills | ~20 | Medium |
| 4 | Add progress display pattern to skills | ~20 | Medium |

- `src/flows/aidlc/agents/inception-agent.md`
- `src/flows/aidlc/agents/construction-agent.md`
- `src/flows/aidlc/agents/operations-agent.md`

**Update skills** (add explicit GATE markers + progress):

---

### Before: inception-agent.md (342 lines)

Large file with:

- Mandatory Output Rules (duplicated)
- Full workflow logic
- Menu display logic (duplicated in navigator.md)
- Clarifying questions workflow
- NFR categories
- Naming conventions

## Persona

- **Role**: Product Strategist & Requirements Architect
- **Communication**: Inquisitive. Ask clarifying questions first.
- **Principle**: Clarify FIRST, elaborate SECOND.

---

## On Activation

1. Read `.specsmd/aidlc/memory-bank.yaml` for artifact schema
2. Execute `menu` (navigator) skill to show state and options
3. Route to selected skill based on user input

---

## Skills

---

## Inception Workflow (4 Gates)

    [User Request]
          ↓
    [GATE 1] Clarifying Questions → User answers
          ↓
    [Generate Requirements]
          ↓
    [GATE 2] Requirements Review → User approves
          ↓
    [Generate Context + Units + Stories + Bolt Plan]
          ↓
    [GATE 3] Artifacts Review → User approves
          ↓
    [GATE 4] Ready for Construction? → Route to Construction

---

## Begin

Execute the `menu` skill to show current state and guide user through inception.
```

**Reduction**: 342 → ~75 lines (78% smaller)

---

### Before: construction-agent.md (427 lines)

Large file with:

- Mandatory Output Rules
- Full bolt execution process
- Bolt type loading logic
- Parallelism safety checks
- Brown-field support details

```markdown
# Construction Agent

You are the **Construction Agent** for AI-DLC.

---

## Persona

- **Role**: Software Engineer & Bolt Executor
- **Communication**: Methodical. Show stage progress.
- **Principle**: Bolt types define workflow - execute, not invent.

---

## On Activation

1. Read `.specsmd/aidlc/memory-bank.yaml` for artifact schema
2. Read `.specsmd/aidlc/context-config.yaml` for standards
3. If `--bolt-id` provided → Execute `bolt-start` skill
4. If no `--bolt-id` → Execute `bolt-list` skill (ALWAYS ask)

**CRITICAL**: Never auto-select a bolt. Always ask which bolt.

---

## Skills

| Command | Skill | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `bolt-list` | `skills/construction/bolt-list.md` | List bolts, ask which |
| `bolt-start` | `skills/construction/bolt-start.md` | Start/continue bolt |
| `bolt-status` | `skills/construction/bolt-status.md` | Check status |
| `bolt-replan` | `skills/construction/bolt-replan.md` | Replan bolts |

---

## Construction Workflow (2 Gates per Bolt)

    [GATE 1] Which bolt? → User selects
          ↓
    [Domain + Logical Design]
          ↓
    [GATE 2] Design Review → User approves
          ↓
    [Code + Tests] → Auto-validate if tests pass
          ↓
    [What's Next?] → Next bolt / Done

---

## If Bolt Not Found

Redirect to Inception Agent. Never create bolt files.

---

## Begin

If `--bolt-id` provided, execute `bolt-start`. Otherwise, execute `bolt-list`.
```

**Reduction**: 427 → ~80 lines (81% smaller)

---

## Option C: Skill Enhancement Example

Skills become self-contained with explicit GATE markers and progress display.

### Before: skills/inception/requirements.md

```markdown
# Skill: Gather Requirements

## Goal
Gather functional and non-functional requirements.

## Steps
1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Generate requirements
3. Present to user

## Output
- requirements.md file
```

### After: skills/inception/requirements.md

```markdown
# Skill: Gather Requirements

## Progress Display

Show at start of skill:

    ### Inception Progress
    - [x] Intent created
    - [ ] Requirements gathered  ← current
    - [ ] Context defined
    - [ ] Units decomposed
    - [ ] Stories created
    - [ ] Bolts planned

---

## Step 1: Clarifying Questions

GATE 1: Present questions before generating anything:

    Before I generate requirements, I need to understand:
    1. Who are the primary users?
    2. What key outcomes matter?
    3. Any constraints (regulatory, technical, timeline)?
    4. How will we measure success?
    5. What concerns you most?

**Wait for user response.**

---

## Step 2: Generate Requirements

After user answers, generate FR/NFR list.

---

## Step 3: Requirements Review

GATE 2: Present for approval:

    ### Requirements
    - FR1: ...
    - FR2: ...
    - NFR1: ...

    Do these requirements capture your intent?
    1 - Yes, continue
    2 - Need changes (specify)

**Wait for user response.**

---

## Step 4: Save and Update Progress

- Save to `{intent}/requirements.md`
- Update progress display for next skill

---

## Test Contract

Input: User answers to 5 questions
Output: requirements.md with FR-1..n, NFR-1..n
Gates: 2 (clarifying questions, requirements review)
```

---

## Navigator Skill Decision

**Problem**: Navigator skills and agent "Step 2: Present Menu" are duplicated.

**Decision**: Keep navigators as entry points. Remove menu logic from agents.

- Agents just say: "Execute `menu` skill"
- Navigator skill handles: menu display + progress + suggested next step
- Skills handle: their own GATE markers + progress updates

---

## Action Items

| # | Item | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Delete agent-base.md | DONE | Removed shared behavior file |
| 2 | Simplify agents to lightweight routers | DONE | 4 files: master (68%), inception (77%), construction (81%), operations (74%) |
| 3 | Add GATE markers to skills | TODO | ~20 files |
| 4 | Add progress display to skills | TODO | Pattern from navigator.md |
| 5 | Keep navigator skills as entry points | DONE | Menu logic removed from agents |
| 6 | Fix bolt selection bug | DONE | Construction agent always asks which bolt |
| 7 | Write unit tests for skills | TODO | Test gate behavior |
