# Unit Brief: Master Agent

## Overview

The Master Agent is the central orchestrator of the specsmd system. It analyzes project state, routes users to specialist agents, and facilitates project initialization through a comprehensive standards system.

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- Agent persona and definition
- Project state analysis (analyze-context skill)
- User routing to specialist agents (route-request skill)
- AI-DLC explanation (explain-flow skill)
- Project/process Q&A (answer-question skill)
- Project initialization via standards (project-init skill)

### Out of Scope

- Inception phase execution (Inception Agent)
- Construction phase execution (Construction Agent)
- Operations phase execution (Operations Agent)

---

## Technical Context

### Entry Points

- `/specsmd-master-agent` - Activate Master Agent (the ONLY command - no aliases)

### Dependencies

- Memory Bank schema (`memory-bank.yaml`)
- Memory Bank artifacts (intents, units, bolts)
- Standards catalog (`templates/standards/catalog.yaml`)
- Facilitation guides (`templates/standards/*.guide.md`)

### Outputs

- Project health dashboard
- Routing recommendations
- Initialized standards files in `memory-bank/standards/`

---

## Standards System (project-init skill)

The project-init skill uses a three-tier architecture to create project standards:

### 1. Standards Catalog (`catalog.yaml`)

The catalog is the registry of all available standards and their configuration.

**Location**: `.specsmd/aidlc/templates/standards/catalog.yaml`

**Structure**:

```yaml
standards:
  tech-stack:
    description: Technology choices for the project
    facilitation: templates/standards/tech-stack.guide.md
    output_path: standards/tech-stack.md
    importance: critical
    decisions:
      - id: languages
        display_name: Languages
        category: core
        importance: critical
        depends_on: []
      - id: framework
        display_name: Framework
        depends_on: [languages]
      # ... more decisions

project_types:
  full-stack-web:
    required_standards: [tech-stack, coding-standards]
    recommended_standards: [system-architecture, ux-guide, api-conventions]
  # ... more project types
```

**Key Concepts**:

- **Standards**: High-level categories (tech-stack, coding-standards, system-architecture, ux-guide, api-conventions)
- **Decisions**: Individual choices within a standard (languages, framework, database, etc.)
- **Dependencies**: Decisions can depend on other decisions (`framework` depends on `languages`)
- **Importance**: critical, high, medium - determines required vs optional
- **Project Types**: Presets that define which standards to create based on project type

### 2. Facilitation Guides (`*.guide.md`)

Guides are conversational prompts that help the Master Agent facilitate standards decisions with the user.

**Location**: `.specsmd/aidlc/templates/standards/{standard-name}.guide.md`

**Purpose**:

- Guide discovery through conversation, not forms
- Adapt communication style based on user expertise
- Surface tradeoffs the user may not have considered
- Capture rationale, not just the choice

**Structure**:

```markdown
# {Standard Name} Facilitation Guide

## Purpose
Why this standard matters

## Facilitation Approach
How to have the conversation

## Discovery Areas
### 1. {Decision Area}
**Goal**: What we're trying to understand
**Explore**: Questions to ask
**Guide by use case**: Recommendations table
**Validate**: Confirm understanding before moving on

## Completing the Discovery
Summary template

## Output Generation
Template for the final standard file
```

**Available Guides**:

- `tech-stack.guide.md` - Technology choices (languages, framework, database, ORM, auth, infrastructure)
- `coding-standards.guide.md` - Code style (formatting, linting, naming, testing, error handling, logging)
- `system-architecture.guide.md` - Architecture patterns (style, API design, state management, caching, security)
- `ux-guide.guide.md` - UI/UX patterns (design system, styling, accessibility, responsive)
- `api-conventions.guide.md` - API design (style, versioning, response format, errors, pagination)

### 3. Generated Standards (Output)

The final output files created in `memory-bank/standards/`.

**Location**: `memory-bank/standards/{standard-name}.md`

**Example tech-stack.md**:

```markdown
# Tech Stack

## Overview
Core technology decisions for this project.

## Languages
TypeScript

Node.js runtime with TypeScript for type safety and modern tooling.

## Framework
Next.js 14

Full-stack React framework with App Router for SSR/SSG capabilities.

## Database
PostgreSQL (via Supabase)

Managed PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions and auth integration.

## ORM / Database Client
Prisma

Type-safe database access with excellent Next.js integration.

## Authentication
Supabase Auth

Integrated auth with social providers and row-level security.

## Infrastructure & Deployment

## Package Manager
pnpm

Fast, disk-efficient package manager with monorepo support.
```

### Project Initialization Flow

```text
User invokes /specsmd-master-agent (redirected to project-init for uninitialized projects)
         │
         ▼
Master Agent reads catalog.yaml
         │
         ▼
Agent asks: "What type of project?" (shows project_types)
         │
         ▼
Based on project type, determine required/recommended standards
         │
         ▼
For each required standard:
    │
    ├── Read facilitation guide
    │
    ├── Have guided conversation with user
    │
    ├── Capture decisions and rationale
    │
    └── Generate standard file to memory-bank/standards/
         │
         ▼
Offer to facilitate recommended (optional) standards
         │
         ▼
Project initialization complete
```

## Implementation Notes

### Persona Characteristics

- Role: AI-DLC Flow Orchestrator & Project Navigator
- Communication Style: Concise and directive (for routing), conversational and adaptive (for standards)
- Principle: Route based on project state, not user guesses

### Critical Actions

1. ALWAYS read `memory-bank.yaml` first
2. READ project state before routing
3. ANALYZE before routing - never send to wrong agent
4. NEVER assume project state - verify by reading files
5. For project-init: READ catalog.yaml, then use appropriate guide
6. CAPTURE rationale for decisions, not just the choices
7. ADAPT communication style based on user's expertise level

### Output Formatting Requirements

All agent outputs MUST follow the output formatting standards:

- 🚫 **NEVER** use ASCII tables for options
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use numbered list format: `N - **Option**: Description`
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use status indicators: ✅ (done) ⏳ (current) [ ] (pending) 🚫 (blocked)
- ✅ **ALWAYS** end with suggested next step pattern

See `memory-bank/standards/output-formatting.md` for complete specification.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Context Analysis

- GIVEN Master Agent is invoked
- WHEN reading project state
- THEN agent correctly identifies current phase (none, inception, construction, operations)
- AND provides accurate routing recommendation

### AC-2: Routing Accuracy

- GIVEN project has intents but no bolts started
- WHEN user asks "what should I do next"
- THEN agent routes to Inception Agent for story/bolt planning

### AC-3: Project Initialization

- GIVEN fresh project with no standards
- WHEN user invokes project-init
- THEN agent reads catalog.yaml
- AND asks project type
- AND facilitates required standards based on type
- AND generates standard files in memory-bank/standards/

### AC-4: Standards Facilitation

- GIVEN project-init in progress
- WHEN facilitating tech-stack standard
- THEN agent follows tech-stack.guide.md
- AND adapts communication to user expertise
- AND captures both decisions AND rationale
- AND generates tech-stack.md with all decisions
