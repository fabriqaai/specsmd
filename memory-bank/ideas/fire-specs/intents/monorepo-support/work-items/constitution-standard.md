# Add Constitution Standard Type

## Description

Introduce `constitution.md` as a new standard file type that contains universal policies applying to ALL code in the project. Unlike other standards (tech-stack, coding-standards, testing-standards), constitution is ALWAYS inherited from root and cannot be overridden by modules.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add `constitution.md` to memory-bank.yaml schema
- [ ] Create constitution template in project-init skill
- [ ] Update project-init to generate constitution.md during initialization
- [ ] Document constitution's special inheritance behavior
- [ ] Existing projects without constitution.md continue to work (graceful fallback)

## Constitution Content Guidelines

Constitution should contain policies that are:
- Truly universal (apply regardless of language/framework)
- Non-negotiable (not a matter of preference)
- Process-oriented (how we work, not what tools we use)

### Belongs in Constitution

```markdown
# Project Constitution

## Git Workflow
- Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, chore:, etc.)
- All changes via pull request
- Require at least one approval before merge

## Code Review
- No self-merging to main/master
- Security-sensitive changes require security review
- Breaking changes require explicit approval

## CI/CD
- All PRs must pass CI before merge
- Main branch is always deployable
- No secrets in code (use environment variables)

## Security Policies
- No credentials in source control
- Dependencies must be from approved sources
- Security vulnerabilities must be addressed within SLA
```

### Does NOT Belong in Constitution

- Language-specific rules (belongs in coding-standards)
- Test framework preferences (belongs in testing-standards)
- Build tool configuration (belongs in tech-stack)

## Schema Changes

Update `memory-bank.yaml`:

```yaml
schema:
  # ... existing paths ...
  constitution: ".specs-fire/standards/constitution.md"
```

## Template: constitution.md.hbs

```handlebars
# Project Constitution

> Universal policies that apply to ALL code in this project.
> This file is always inherited from root - modules cannot override it.
